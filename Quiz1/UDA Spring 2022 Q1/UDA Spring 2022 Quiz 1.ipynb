In the code cell below, please write code that fills in the variable `term_frequency_table` (a 2D numpy array, where rows correspond to questions in the same order as they appear in `subset_questions` that you computed in **subpart i**, and columns correspond to the different vocabulary words in the same order as they appear in `vocab`).\n",

Iterate through the tokens of this parsed spacy Doc, convert each token to lowercase (do not lemmatize) and if the lowercase token appears in `vocab`, then you increment the count for the lowercase token by 1 in the i-th row of `term_frequency_table` (you have to figure out what column index the token corresponds to).\n",
