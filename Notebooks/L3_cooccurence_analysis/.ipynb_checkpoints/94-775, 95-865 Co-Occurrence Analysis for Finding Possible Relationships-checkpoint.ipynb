    "\n",
    "This last part of the demo assumes that you know [Pearson's chi-squared test for independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test). This is effectively what we are doing: seeing if people and companies are independent (if they are, then in subsequent data analyses, we can focus on other relationships that could be more promising). However, for the chi-squared test to actually work as advertised, we need to check that the assumptions of the test hold (otherwise the p-value derived from the test is *not* valid!). Importantly, in practice, often we don't care about p-values and don't need to report them either. *In fact, we might only be interested in computing the phi-squared/chi-squared/Cram√©r's V values only for the purposes of ranking different pairings of named entity types, in which case the exact values don't really matter, just the ordering!*\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, it is important to understand that in unstructured data analysis, sometimes how we use statistical tools is going to be a bit of a hack, meaning that strictly speaking we are not using a tool like how it is supposed to be used. Don't panic. In all sorts of endeavors involving working with data, there are going to be hacks. That said, it is good to know when something we use is a hack and why!\n",
    "\n",
    "In computing the `chi_squared` variable from earlier, I mentioned that it is related to the chi-squared test. However, there is a catch: for it to actually correspond to a chi-squared test, we need the co-occurrence table to have a specific independence condition *that is not guaranteed to hold in how we constructed the co-occurrence table!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, recall that the co-occurrence table we used in lecture and in the demo is:\n",
    "\n",
    "| <i></i>       | Alphabet | AMD  | Tesla |\n",
    "| ------------- |:--------:|:----:|:-----:|\n",
    "| Elon Musk     | 1500     | 1000 | 20000 |\n",
    "| Sundar Pichai | 1000     | 50   | 50    |\n",
    "| Lisa Su       | 30       | 700  | 10    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the numbers correspond to the number of articles that mention both a specific person and a specific company.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pearson's chi-squared test, a key assumption is that of the 1500 articles counted that mention both Elon Musk and Alphabet, these 1500 articles are *not* also counted in any of the other table entries. For example, for the 1000 articles that mention both Elon Musk and AMD, these 1000 articles should not have any overlap with the 1500 articles that mention both Elon Musk and Alphabet! Basically, for any specific article, it can only be counted once across all the numbers in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "How could we have constructed the co-occurrence table so that we are guaranteed that this key assumption holds? There's a simple fix: each time we look at an article, we look at all the co-occurrences it contains, and we arbitrarily choose one of them (for example, we can uniformly at random pick one of the pairings of person/company found) and that's the only co-occurrence that we actually add to the co-occurrence table for that specific article. This fix would ensure that each article is counted at most once in the co-occurrence table! (An article could be counted 0 times if it doesn't mention any person/company pairs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the chi-squared statistical test to make sense, we do need this key assumption to hold. A full list of assumptions needed for the chi-squared test can be found on the [chi-square test Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test). **As a reminder, when not all the assumptions are met, then the p-value you obtain will not be statistically valid.** If we don't actually care about statistical significance/validity, we can still compute phi-squared/chi-squared and choose an arbitrary cutoff to decide on whether to flag people and companies as being an interesting pairing to analyze further, or to consider them to be an uninteresting pairing that does not warrant further analysis.\n",
