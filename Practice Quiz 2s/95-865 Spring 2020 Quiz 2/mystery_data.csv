"beware - this office seem to specialize in overbooking appointments and offer selective information for the consumer.  it's one of those offices that forget to include important details until after the damage has been done.

unless you're retired and have all the time in the world to spend waiting for your appointment time, camping out in the hallway instead of inside of the office space, or just love the absence of return phone calls - i wouldn't bother.",1
fantastic food with great service. i can't remember my waitresses name but she was very friendly and funny. the shrimp cargo is fabulous and the baby back ribs were amazing. i'm lucky enough to have this place close by my house. will be coming back for a long time.,5
"expected better service from previous reviews but could have been an off night. the good: shrimp ebi sushi, stuffed chicken wings and roasted garlic situ ramen. the bad: snow crab croquette and a soft mushy texture, pressed sushi salmon had way too much rice. would come back to try more of the menu. overall a very good quality restaurant in markham.",4
"i love this pasta. fresh pasta is always better than boxed and dried, but i rarely have the time...or want to take the time to make my own. ocp is awesome and delicious and i love trying out all of the different varieties. i've always been a pasta addict and ocp is not helping with my problem. at all. stop it guys. i'm so totally kidding don't stop...ever.",5
korean-style churros! we got the special with chocolate glaze and almond topping. crunchy shell with cakey centre and not too sweet - delicious!! the two young men that served us were genuinely nice! good service...,4
"visited mix with high expectations, and they were more than met!  the dining room is beautiful and elegant, yet also simple.  the staff were well versed in their menu and attentive without the constant stream of ""how is everything"" that is often passed off for good service.  and the night view of las vegas from the 64th floor was amazing.

yet the real star was the food.  each item at our table  was perfect.  and while this is certainly cheap dining, it stacks up very nicely to more expensive options in the area.

i will definitely revisit on future trips.",5
i love love love this place!!! cider + pasty = amazing lunch or dinner.,5
"i have taken a few foster dogs and my own puppy to this clinic. the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. they have worked to squeeze me in at the last minute.

they don't push for unnecessary treatments but provide information to make informed choices.",5
"this diner has regressed since a year and a half ago. the food was mediocre in all 3 visits this year and the service was lacking on one particular midnight visit.

i had ordered a drink for a friend that was visiting at another table that the waitress forgot. this late friend ordered her food 15 minutes after us yet got her food 10 minutes before anybody else did. bizarre. overall, we  had waited about 45 minutes for our food.

 when this fact was pointed out, she brought her manager out instead of just telling us what was up. all he could do was assure us the food was coming out. when it did, my dish was cold and seemed like it had been standing under the heat lamp for a while.

the other visits were not remarkable but neither was the food.",2
"i had the large pastrami reuben on sourdough. large is no joke, big enough for 3 & delicious. ate it for 2 days. my only reason not to give stars is the $3 delivery & $17 minimum for delivery. it's a lot of extra if one person wants to order lunch.",4
"so mooyah is a texas based chain and i read online that they want to open 5-8 of these places across cleveland in the next 5 years, but i really hope they don't do this.  i stopped by this new fast-food joint on a laid-back sunday evening and when i walked in i was greeted 3 times ""welcome to mooyah!"". a bit of an overkill, but thanks for the welcome. the interior was clean with plenty of tables and a get your own soda dispenser. the staff was comprised of 7 teenagers and 2 adult managers. i can only assume it was a training day for them all to be there because there were only a couple customers. i placed my order and was given a plastic card with a number on it for when they call my to-go order up. 

i started off with a plain single burger on an ""artisan"" white bun at $5.69 then added blue cheese .70¢, bacon .99¢, and lettuce. that's a total of $7.38 for a single bacon cheeseburger. so the burger, i'd actually call this a meat pancake because it was pressed out so thin and was bigger than the bun. also, the meat was salty and way over cooked. one side of the burger had a hardened crust from being on the grill so long and the meat was completely dried out, which is weird seeing as how there was a ton of grease on the packaging. not a lot of blue cheese - only tasted it in the center of the burger,  and for that .99¢ i got one strip of bacon broken into a couple pieces. the good here was the lettuce - they didn't skimp on it and it was fresh and crisp. 

the small fries come in at $2.49 but actually seem like a large amount that you could share. however i shared mine with the garbage can as they were over seasoned and over cooked. i'm not talking golden and crispy here, i'm talking brown and dried out. very disappointing. i ate about 1\/4 then threw the rest away. the spicy ranch sauce i used to dip a few fries in was good though. 

small oreo milkshake $3.49. it was good with whip cream and a cherry on top, i liked that it was not as sweet as the oreo shake at burger king. my complaints here are that they immediately make your milkshake so it's done and melting while the rest of your food cooks even though you asked for it to-go. so no lid and several times i had to wipe up dipping milkshake from my hands and from wherever i set down the cup. also if you want to substitute crushed oreo's instead of the chocolate chips in the mint milkshake that will cost you .70¢ more. 

i'm sorry but i just can't support this place, the food was not that good and to me it's overpriced for the quality they serve. usually i try to give places a second shot, but i have no desire to come back to mooyah. just go to five guys or bearden's or pay more and get a ""gourmet"" burger from flip side. *side note: i noticed a lot of 5 star reviews from people who have no picture, no friends, and haven't reviewed other businesses... now 7 of these reviews have been hidden by yelp so far, but it still makes me really weary that something shady is going on. if you sell a good product you won't have to write fake glowing reviews.",1
"this is the worse service i have ever seen anyone receive in a hospital.  my son and his wife recently went in to have their first child at this hospital and from the time we walked in the door i suggested to them that we leave and go somewhere else.  

my daughter in law went in bleeding during her 8 month pregnancy and was told to lie in a room and a doctor would see her in about 2 hours.  she waited in that room almost 10 hours without seeing a doctor and without the nurses explaining anything to her.  she didn't see a doctor until the delivery started.  the nurses didn't seem to care that she was in pain and just made jokes while she complained about being in pain.  they seemed to be more concerned about whether she had insurance than taking care of her.  they have food on the wards for patients and guest who stay with them but when my son asked them for a sandwich, which he had seen in the refrigerator they told hem they didn't have anymore even though he had seen it in the refrigerator.  they even forgot to feed her dinner the next day.  

it was a horrible experience that i hope to never have again.",1
"i tried this place for lunch and had a great experience.   i tried the sausage and peppers sandwich... that was awesome.   they even had march madness on tv.  i think the prices are a little on the high side but they're a mom & pop restaurant so i understand.  

i'll be back soon...",5
"fun!  kinda like a marcs combined with a big lots.  the place is huge and has aisles and aisles of books, toys, home items, tools, dvds, carpet, all kinds of things.  prices are pretty good - definitely cheaper than a ""regular"" store, but of course, some of the things here are a little on the ""junk"" side of things.  very friendly staff.",4
do not stay here. i have never had such a terrible experience staying at a hotel before. let alone a 4-5 star hotel. our room was broken into and we were robbed while staying here. the front desk staff was rude. even the front desk supervisor had some sass. i understand they are busy and probably deal with crappy people all day long but that's no excuse to treat every single person that comes through like crap right off the bat. i've had better customer service staying at a holiday inn. you're better off staying somewhere else.,1
"tried this place twice. first time got the korean taco and cucumber margarita. the korean taco was very flavorful but the beef was too sweet and fried for my taste. the cucumber margarita was unfortunately not as spicy as i had expected. the second time i tried the octopus (tako) taco and lychee and pepper margarita and it changed my life... mind blown! the margarita was amazing, not too spicy with this awesome smokey taste. the tako taco was perfection in taste. will definitely be back for this amazing combination.",5
"my family and i absolutely love this place. it's hard enough finding vegetarian restaurants, but to find one that's delicious and affordable? that's exactly what veggie house is. i cannot recommend it enough. do yourself a favor, go!",5
"tl;dr: never going back to this place after 15 years of being a customer. the worst food poisoning ever. 

my review will be in 2 parts, the first for the actual food. the second for the day after. 

for the record, i've been eating at tokyo house roughly 15 years. i work close by, and i've always lived in driving distance. i've loved this place since a kid. it use to be run by a little old man and his wife, but is now run by new owners... this is when everything has changed.

i went here last week and ordered beef yakisoba, a normal go to for me. i normally ask for it spicy but went regular this time around. normally i'm asked if i'd like rice or not (which i normally decline as the dish is suppose to be all noodles) i received my food, where immediately i knew something was different. since there was new owners, i figured there was a new cook and maybe things have just changed. i gave it a shot..... and i've never regretted a decision so much in my life. 

the normal dark consistency of the noodles wasn't there, it was a lite sauce lacking any real vegetables or meat for that matter. in total i counted 7 small pieces of beef. they added rice without asking (eh whatever) but on top of that the portions have changed fairly drastically from what it use to be. i get cutting back on portion sizes, but meat and vegetables to? what am i really paying for here? 8$ for just a bowl of noodles? the taste itself was a little sour, almost not pleasant but i kept going to see if it would grow on me. inside of the dish were water chestnuts, which were never in before and i enjoy them so no complaints. however biting into them was sour, almost like they were opened and sitting out over night. i stopped with the food about half way through and tossed it in the trash.

disclaimer: tmi

the following day 6am strikes me with urgency. my bodys way of letting me know to get up now before you crap the bed. the hail storm of watery half solid chunks of feces spewed from my body with such force the water splashed around in the bowl. i knew today would be a bad day, i call out of a work and attempt to go back to sleep. 

within 30 minutes i'm up again, my body calling me back to the sacred holy ground which is my toilet. the only way to describe what was happening in there was this... imagine your a kid again in the pool and you fill up one of those water launchers and then you try to push it out with all your force. at this point i get in the shower and after i try to go back to sleep again.

30 minutes goes by again, at this point i'm up. as i'm sitting on the toilet for round 3, the urge to puke begins. as i'm bent over the tub praying to jesus i puke already a sensation rushes down to my sphincter. i jump into the shower and prepare for the worst. thats when it all happens. those convulsions you get from puking when you tense up so much you can't control the rest of your body. i release from both ends with such force. i turn on the water and it hits my back like cold little knives cutting my skin. i start to see the remains of one end of my body flow down the drain. i immediately begin to puke again. 

the rest of the day was constantly running back and forth from the bathroom, dry heves, and a fever. i could of went more into detail but i figured i'd spare you all the hardship.

i will never be going back to this restaurant. 15 years and you trying to cut corners on your food has lost you a loyal customer.",1
"chris was professional, on time and full of helpful information.  i appreciated his honesty and suggestions.  we have been costumes of az cold air for more than 10 years and have had only excellent service.",5
"western style place that captures a cowboy atmosphere. there's a lot of outdoor seating and a good happy hour food menu.

i got the riblets for happy hour. they were very good, especially at that price. meat falls off the bones. it's a wet style rib. 

we then did a line dancing class for $5. class was quite popular\/crowded and somewhat advanced. attracts an older crowd. overall a fun place.",4
"we use a higher end dog food to feed our pup so we're used to driving up to scottsdale to purchase it...so i was thrilled to discover that pet club opened a brand-spanking-new location near the biltmore!  not only is it clean and well-stocked inside but the prices for food, treats, etc. are far less expensive than competitors in the same caliber of pet stores.  i also want to commend the nice employee who carried my heavy, 35 pound bag of dog food out to my car for me.  welcome to the neighborhood, pet club!",5
"i have changed my mind about this place.  new bartenders are delightful.  janet is my favorite.  oh yeah... jessica, missy, and jamee too.  the people are so fun to hang with.  no need to come with anyone.. the place is welcoming.",5
very friendly and caring staff! dr brian page listened to my concerns and came up with a treatment plan that fits with my lifestyle. i felt he really care and i don't feel like i'm just a number in a medical center. great patient care.,5
"if your looking for great taste for indian cuisin this is the place. service is awesome! food is excellent! price is right on the dollar. my menu, chicken masala, chicken tikka and the tandoori chicken is the must have or at least try.  happy service+good food=happy customer.  one of my favorite place to go too atleast twice a month.  location not so hot, but who cares food is what we're talking about here.",4
"i've had cox 300mbps residential internet package for the last 3-4 years. it was constantly going in and out. so much so that i had to have backup cellular internet to automatically switch over every time cox would fail. switched to lv.net last week and can already tell a huge difference. speeds and service are always constant, regardless of the time of day. their residential 25mbps package is much more reliable and faster than cox's 300mbps plan. highly recommend this company.",5
"tldr: 
-no respect for residents
-management avoids all responsibility
-they only see you for money not as guests or residents.
-you can spend a lot less money to find better places around here
-they do not post all reviews on their websites, only the good ones.
-very unfriendly to students or anyone that likes it quiet
-hallways smell like urine, smoke, and bad moldy carpet. all trying to be covered up by terrible air freshener
-people steal packages because the office does not accept packages past their office hours, which are very limited as they go on long lunch breaks and close early most days
--take it from a future doctor, be smart and do not rent from these guys. unless you're into getting ripped off and disrespected, then go for it

current resident, just tried to ask for some help from the front desk during their saturday hours (closes at 5pm). i went there at 2pm, there was a sign on one door saying it was open, please come in. another sign on the front door said they would be back at 12:15. i thought the front desk was out showing people apartments, but i went to the front entrance and there was a guy sitting in the front office. i pointed to the door and he just put a really sour look on his face and shook his head. this continued until he just walked away and ignored me.
luckily, a guy looking to rent from them also arrived. i told him about what happened to me.
basically, if they treat their residents like this, why would you ever want to rent from them?

will update review later.

update:
called yvette in the front office at 4:30, after trying to get a hold of someone all day, she comes back to tell me that the reason the time signs weren't changed is because she was out. but, why wouldn't you change the time signs to tell people you're out??? then she tells me that the maintenance person did not get the door for me because he can't help me (but neither can she??). how am i supposed to know that he was in maintenance??  he didnt even have the courtesy to tell me anything. then yvette,  from the ever helpful front desk, tells us she cant even help us until her manager gets there 2 days from now. the number from to the front desk is listed as an ""emergency number,"" but i guess emergencies take two days to even look at. i told her that i will probably move if the problem persists and she just shook it off like she's not trying to retain any residents. she basically said anything to avoid responsibility. sick managing skills there yvette, wonder how that job interview went? like, can u answer phone calls and go to lunch for hours? yeah? you're hired.

i guess i'll go talk her manager, see if they're any less useless. will update.",1
"so as i was waiting to get my hair colored, i decided to stop into blu basil to try their version of a filet salad.. 

the salad was lovely, walnuts, cranberries, gorgonzola cheese, and mixed greens. i asked for the protein to be added. 

the original dressing it came with was no bueno - so i asked for some balsamic - which was a 100% better, but really thick and creamy -- trying to lose some lbs for my nye dress... 

like i said, the salad was lovely, but the meat was nasty... it tasted old... i tried salting it... covering it with dressing, but just could not get past that old frozen taste. 

this scares me and i'm pretty certain i will not return. the only reason it got two stars is the water tasted nice and the salad was fresh.",2
"this is my favourite starbucks in montreal, for the simple reason, i love the staff here, i used to do some of my freelance work here, and i got to know the staff. people can make a place so much better and that's exactly why i would give this place 5 stars.",5
"we stayed at the westin cleveland because there was a really great deal on living social.  we had an event at the convention center, located next door so it worked out perfectly.  i looked at reviews prior to staying and i don't think people truly understand what a one and two star hotel is.  this is not one of them.  

i travel to at least a dozen different cities throughout the year for work and stay in different hotels all the time.  cleveland is now a popular travel destination.  with a hotel like this and the location within the city, the price is expected.  the $30\/day valet fee is not unheard of, nor is the price of wifi in rooms.  i see this all the time at hotels like this.  

the hotel is clearly new as you can smell the new furniture and carpet in the rooms.  very spacey room with comfortable beds.  the bathrooms are nice and everything was clean upon arrival.  i found the hotel staff to be courteous and helpful.  

as far as location goes, this is a prime spot.  you are centrally located from cleveland browns stadium and the rock hall\/science center.  you are less than a half a mile from e. 4th street and all the restaurants and bars it has to offer (less than a 10 minute walk).  it would be another five minutes to the q and progressive field or casino. i;m sure it would be a cheap cab ride if you didn't want to walk.  

the days of downtown cleveland hotels being cheap are long gone.  there are a lot of things to do and the westin is a great place to stay!",5
"freaking incredible genius right here...  stopped at strip n dip with three teenagers while visiting vegas, and we all left feeling full and satisfied.  visiting vegas? take a break from the bank-busting buffets and experience a whole other kind of strip.  my only regret is that i didn't try the mac and cheese.",5

"the first time i went to bachi burger was because it was on the travel channel \/ food network and since i am a burger lover i thought i give this place a shot. when i went i really wasnt too thrilled about it. it was whatevers to me. i decided to give it a second try since my friend says its good and was surprised i didnt like it. this time it was what i expected! it was really good. that juicy, tender moist asian flavored burger was bomb... it was called spicy miyo .. for apps we had the fried calamari with a side of their flavored sauces and jalapeno on it. yumm!! for desert i had the portuguese donuts .. which was ok!the side of the coffee gelato was good. deff will come back next time i crave something exotic.",4
"well i've been here before a few years ago twice actually and wasn't much of a fan ...mostly due to the service to be honest .
but today a few of us came here to the patio , and boy was i pleased !!!
the food was actually very good ! very fresh and very impressed ! good portions aswell ! 
the atmosphere both outside and in very nice .
all in all it was a good afternoon and i'd definitely come back , atleast for the patio .",4
"* sigh *  thursday, july 2nd, 2009.  my last night @ el cardinal?

only time will tell.  my facebook page said this was going to be the 'last latin night' at the cardinal so, being as though i'm mostly a homebody in madison when it comes to late night, i had to go.

time to get all ""suited & booted"" so to speak; i mean ""the cardinal"".  i came here in college; when i turned 21 this was the place to go saturday night for musica de salsa y merengue.  i came here religiously, every saturday evening for 5 years straight to get my saturday salsa on.  then they switched it to thursday and began 18 and up night here and i stopped going so much...

i enjoyed the atmosphere tonight, even with the teeny boppers.  it was a serious reunion.  people i hadn't seen in years were there, it was great.  we took lots and lots of photographs.

the place had a good vibe going tonight; david muhammad was dj'ing some merengue, ol' skool salsa and freestyle.  wow.  incredible.  i have missed the place; the two (2) corey's were bar tending as well as paulo and my stoli strawberry & 7-ups were really right on the money tonight.

all in all, cardinal you were something else; moments like these really make me feel old even being in my early 30's.  at the end of the evening i hear it is not only the last latin night but it's closing in a day or two (semi) permanently.  * sigh *  a true madison icon this place is.

your jagged tile floor.  

you're hot-n-steamy windows.  

your new and improved ladies room.  

your 'dance on me' speakers.  

i hope to be at your re-opening\/return should there come such a day...",4
"i receive fine service every time i come here. the employees are mainly hispanic as noted in a previous review, but this is a hispanic neighborhood. there is no language barrier and i am always treated with the utmost care when i bank here.",5
"the amber rose is a fairly standard pub for this area of edinburgh. situated in the centre of the new town area of edinburgh, the amber rose is just around the corner from the pub central area of edinburgh, rose street and it is a short walk from the main shopping street, princes street and so it is a convenient place to reach. 

it would be very easy to walk straight past this pub and completely not notice it as it on basement level and you have to walk down stairs to get to it, but it is worth a visit. i only came here by complete chance one evening on a pub crawl, and i was glad i did. the staff were the one thing which really stood out for me as they were incredibly welcoming and friendly, definitely some of the best customer service i have ever received. the amber rose serves a good selection of beers, ales, wines and the usual spirit selection, and the drinks are all competitively priced, with a large glass of the house white wine costing under £5. 

food is also served here, and they have a good menu selection of the traditional pub foods such as steak pies, fish and chips, sandwiches and burgers which are also well priced. whether you just want a quiet drink or if you want to make a big night of it, the amber rose is the place to go.",4
"warning!  if you come here with a group of asian guys be prepared to wait for hours and pay extra (bouncer fee) just to get into the pay entrance line.

worst experience and this was this past thursday night! we were there early before 10pm. first off, they didn't approve our guestlist even though we had a print-out. the security who seemed to handpicked almost everyone that was non-asians got in regardless there were on guestlist or not. 

around 11:30pm (we were only about 10 feet from the entrance) trying to buy our way in, security wanted $50 a pop!! wtf!  we all figure heck were really close so let's wait. 

12:45 am and now we are at the front of the line, non asians folks kept on passing us by. as i look back, i see other asians groups going thru what we went thru.

1:15 am - having no choice and tried of waiting, we finally convinced the security ($20 a pop) which then we ended up paying another $30 entrance fee. once inside, we were already pissed and felt discriminated. the waterfall and music was nice but our night felt ruin....

to all of my azn brothers - stay away from this place!!",1

"what a find in a strip mall! the inside is warm and cozy, and i love the open air dining room and patio. like ashley a. and kristin s. said, the live music, while good, was much too loud. carrying on a conversation, while possible, was hampered due to the music.  our server was very nice and let three of us who arrived before happy hour ended at 7 to put a last minute drink order in for us; attentive and patient while waiting on six women.  plus, she was very nice to run 5 different credit cards to pay the bill.

the menu was diverse and included small plates, entrees, and pizza. everyone at the table tried a pizza and the consensus was that they were all very good.  i tried the bruschetta pizza and it was delicious, and i'm not even a huge gourmet pizza fan. my husband ate my leftovers for dinner on friday night, and he said it was delicious as well and it heated up nicely (you never know with leftovers how they will taste the next day!). i thought some of the prices of the small plates were a tad high, but not sure the size of them.  

i'm taking one star off because i didn't find the happy hour price of my wine very much of a deal.  $7.50 for a glass of riesling at happy hour? maybe i'm spoiled by caffe boa's happy hour, but i don't find $7.50 much of a happy hour deal (the glass normally was $9.50). maybe $2 off during happy hour is a deal at a place like javino's, but i've seen better happy hour specials other places.",4
"safety concerns here!
the rooms are spacious, the pools are great,  nice bars and we love pub 365.
the best wings-- ever!
but the gym could be improved with mats, things like a bosu ball medicine balls and jumpropes. 
heck - even some music would be nice. 
the doors leading to the buildings don't always lock and that's a safety issue.  
our biggest complaint is security. our first night there,  we got a call to our room at 10:15 pm.
it was someone saying they were with the hotel and they needed to come in our room because the previous guests left something in the room,  possibly in the safe.
my husband told them no,  because it seemed false. 
we notified security the next morning,  they didn't care.  we saw a patrolling security guy the next day, told him and he didn't care.  
we notified the front desk.  they didn't care.  imagine if we had let that caller in our room.  we would have been robbed!
its going to happen to someone. but no follow up from security to us in efforts to track the call. 
another issue was a red headed female security guard accused my husband of jumping the wall. she says she saw him do it.  apparently they have homeless people jumping the brick wall and wandering the parking lot.  
my husband was walking laps around the complex for exercise. 
she called him a liar, said she saw him jump the wall.   he told her the date we  checked in,  said what room he was staying in, his name and kept walking.  when he came by her a few minutes later,  she said she checked and that he lied to her.  what!?
you don't call a guest, who doesn't look homeless, wearing work out clothes,  carrying a bottle of fiji, a liar three times.
we've stayed here 45 days or more in the last few months so you'd think we wound be known,  and even get some accommodations for being a reoccurring customer.
but when we needed to stay one extra day, we could not get a discount rate like we found available on line when we booked the trip, and had to pay a much higher rate for that one extra night.   no customer service!
we will stay at another hotel from now on.",1

"i went to this place twice in two days.  the first day i sat at a table and was served quickly and the food was hot, right off the griddle  the server was very attentive and conversational.

the next day i sat at the counter and the server behind the bar (hard to label her a ""bartender"" at 8:00 am) was very engaging and friendly.  again, the food was served quickly and was right off the griddle and the coffee was fresh and hot.  

the menu is unique with several great options.  if you're in the area and haven't tried this place, find it.  this place is definitely worth finding.",4

the ""waitress"" if i could call her that was horrible...uncaring about her job and clearly unhappy with waiting on customers... not judging just reporting facts. when the waitress rolls her eyes at you when you say you need a few more minutes!! when you ask the waitress what dressings there are for salads and the waitress points at the menu makes you well aware you have chosen the wrong local establishment to support! piss poor service. piss poor food as well! such a shame though.....i would strongly suggest driving a bit further to blakeney or stonecrest!",1
i eat at rubio's here and there but have never been to this location before. i loved the food as always and i was particularly impressed by the girl bri who worked there. she was very happy and smiley while she was taking my order. i watched as she interacted with other guests (i have been in the restaurant business too) and i was impressed by how she handled herself and other guests. i think she is a great employee and i wanted to share that. i always love the salsa bar with chips! yum!,5
"from out of town and had heard about this place. 
not impressed at all! 
subs were okay. price was alright. 
workers are extremely rude!  need better customer service skills. 
there are so many other choices in pittsburgh, where the staff are friendly and welcoming. 
pass on this one.",1
greasy.  bland.  poor service. flat root beer.  weak sauce.,1
"just got home from dim sum with the family here. i come here for dim sum about once a month. it's one of the better dim sum places in vegas. the line can get pretty long, so we try to come around 11am. today the line started getting long just after 11:15am. 

the food off the dinner menu is good too, but the portions are small. salt & pepper frog legs is one of my favorite dishes here. yup. i said frog legs!! soft like fish and sorta tastes like chicken.",4
"this place has a nice cozy ""farm to table"" feel to it with its reclaimed wood tables, bearded and tattooed bartenders, etc. but let's pull back the hipster facade to examine what really matters...service and food. our server was actually quite good explaining the menu, being attentive as much as possible. yes there were lulls in the service but i would attribute that to overall staffing levels. if you want your own personal entree to come at the same time.. forget it. your side will come and then your protein will come 10 min later. and this varies for each person at the table. the food reviews at the table were also mixed. after i received the salmon for the second time (first time rushed from the kitchen and undercooked) it was good but nothing special. the trout was also dull. the whole chicken & lamb burger received thumbs up. brussels, mac & cheese - although good, nothing special. conclusion: like any ""kid"" this one has some maturing to do.",3
"i called mobile mechanics for a second opinion after the first diagnosis of a blown headgasket and recommendation for a replacement engine (my car had less than 90k miles at this point) at a cost or $4k. the mechanic confirmed the diagnosis and noted a single error code on my receipt indicating a faulty temperature sensor. i spoke to the owner, who stated that the gasket could be replaced and the engine rebuilt at a cost of ~$2k. 

this began a long ordeal with mobile mechanic and the shitty shop he contracts out to in n las vegas, garcia auto repair (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/garcia-auto-repair-las-vegas). i had 2 subsequent breakdowns leaving me stranded in the middle of vegas each time after less than 25 miles of driving. 

the bottom line is that they failed to replace the faulty sensor, which resulted in the head gasket blowing a second time. because the engine block could only take one round of resurfacing my engine was irreparably damaged due to their negligence. mobile mechanic forced me to pay for parts for the second head gasket even though they gave me a 1 yr, 10k mileage warranty. the head of the shop told me, ""you can just keep bringing it in when it breaks down."" the mobile mechanics owner refused to take my calls at this point, so i was screwed. i was afraid to drive my car lest i be stranded in miles from home, so i ended up having to spend the $4k to get the engine replacement at the first shop.",1
"my husband & i think this is the best sushi in the area. every roll that we have tried has always been fresh. if your not into sushi, their lo mein is awsome!",5
"propriétaire hyper sympathique, bonne bouffe, bon prix. le meilleur libanais à lasalle!",5
"it's tough to give a fast food chain 4 stars but this is by far my favorite. i just call it ""crack""cause it addicting. i love the crispy outside of the chicken. the meat is definitely high quality. the sauce is perfect and the side bread is incredibly tasty and incredibly unhealthy. crinkle cut fries are perfect.",4
the staff was amazing and very pleasant! the menu was simple and there were lots of choices. even though it's in the middle of the casino you wouldn't have noticed once you were seated. it is a cute little spot.our server was hilarious and very tentative to us and all his tables. the food was delicious ... this is a place you must visit while in vegas!!!!,5
"words cannot describe how pleased i am with my new cover letter and resume. lindsay is so awesome. this is the best service that i have ever received! lindsay is so thorough and patient. she went above and beyond to answer all of my questions and i will forever be grateful to her for doing so. i was so miserable in numerous positions that i've held throughout my life because i was never passionate about any of them. it finally resonated with me that it was time to pursue a career that would make me happy, so that i could stop job hopping all over the place and become something other than a jack of all trades, master of none. i previously had a resume written by resumewritinggroup and it was horrible. i wouldn't even let a preschooler apply to kindergarten with that resume. i finally came across domyresume.net and i will forever be a customer. thank you #lifechangers",5
"*angels singing* *harps playing* holy moly! what a glorious restaurant experience at bistro 19. this restaurant has been on my ""to visit"" list for years now, but i just never make it out to mt. lebanon. i finally got to visit with a group of friends during restaurant week and i have to say that i'm so glad i left the grit and grime of the city to venture across a very fancy crosswalk and into b19. 
 
we made a reservation for 6:30 and were seated right away. i started off the night with an ""apples and pears"" cocktail which consisted of apple infused boyd & blair vodka, pear nectar, angostura bitters, vanilla-nutmeg syrup, fresh lime juice, and hard cider. it was like someone poured the spirit of christmas into a mason jar-- perfectly spiced and perfectly wonderful.

after drinks, we ordered a trio of hummus to share: plain, pesto, and red pepper. the hummus was a hit. 

next came a basket of bread and butter. the butter got some major praise around the table. i inquired about the butter because it was just too good and i couldn't place the flavors. turns out it's a honey and chive whipped butter. who knew that those flavors would go together so well. 

we all decided to try out the restaurant week special menu. for $35.16 we got to pick between two appetizers, two main courses, and two dessert options. i opted for the wild burgundy snails and leek goat cheese fondue on a baguette for my first course,  the roasted lamb gnocchi for my second course, and chocolate bundt cake to round it out.  the snails were good and the cake was good, but the lamb + gnocchi really stole the show. the lamb was so tender and with just the right amount of fat, that it practically melted in my mouth. the gnocchi were seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly. i think i lost the ability to speak for a good 15 minutes. the only sounds i could make were repeated ""mmmmmms"". it was definitely one of the best dishes i've eaten in pittsburgh.

overall, it was a great experience. the service was top-notch and the atmosphere was the perfect mixture of comfy and classy. my only regret is not trying bistro 19 sooner. just think of how many honey chive butter experiences i could have had by now if i visited 5 years ago when i first heard of the place....",5
"shoubu sushi has now been sold to new owners who have unfortunately cheapened the experience.  most of the dishes that made shoubu a standout restaurant are now gone.  the individual sushi pieces have been made significantly smaller while the prices have remained the same.  there is also a new chef whose skills leave a lot to be desired (some sushi pieces are mis-formed, others are missing key ingredients (like salmon in the spicy salmon roll).  i would not recommend returning to this restaurant.",1
"eclairs to die for! the word foodgasm does not even begin to describe the feeling i got with the first bite! i just want to drown in the filling! 

also- the ii purist is delish. 

every time i go i give their herb infused olive oils the googly eyes but never end up taking it home. lol i will one day!",5
"i have stuff that angie and her t-shirt ninjas made me from 3-4 years ago and the shirts still rock.  the prices aren't bad at all for what you get.  if you're an artistic idiot, like me, then their sales reps can help you design anything you want.  i have two hoodies, some boxers, car decals, and a handful of different shirts done.  no peeling or cracking on the vinyl.

one caution: don't bring in anything about chuck norris.  it's against the store rules, i guess.",5
"i went for lunch after a stressful day, but unfortunately before work so i wasn't able to try the saki the chef had recommended i try since it was my first time there.

the waiter was attentive and the chefs made me feel welcome at the bar. i had to visit alone since my wife is allergic to fish, but unlike many other places i've tried in the past sasa sushi made me feel welcome and comfortable to be there solo.

on the way out i thanked everyone and the chef said see you tomorrow. i wish, but i will be back very soon.

* reasonable prices.
* very clean and modern.
* extremely good food.
* plethora of choices.
* welcoming environment.",5
"stopped in here for lunch on a tuesday afternoon. we all ordered burgers. the service was quick enough and our burgers were pretty good.

one downside was that a member of our party ordered a fried egg to put on his burger, and the waitress (or kitchen) completely forgot about it. she brought it out after he was done eating, which defeated the purpose.",3
"the pho here is really good. the staff was super friendly. the fresh spring rolls are very dry. 

tips using credit\/debit cards- no percentage options says good, great or excellent. you select one and it adds money to your bill. i think great is 20%.",4
"great day of drinking with friends and enjoyed the almost 70 degree weather in january!! we sat outside, no table service - had to get drinks from outside bar - not a big deal until it started to get a little more crowded. we spent about 5 hours here. ran into some friends - thought about playing corn hole and ping-pong, but decided not to. 

drinks and shots were reasonably priced. 

people brought their dogs - kinda cool, since i am a dog owner\/lover. 

i would love to go back and try the food.",4
"clean, bright, well run, teeming with opportunity...what more can you say.  

-- it's a pretty serious poker crowd, not a lot of dead fish.
-- if you want cheap suckers there's lower-end poker rooms.
-- actually decent people that can play cards and have a little conversation.
-- wonderful wait staff, very fast and attentive, and easy to look at.

i sat here a few hours during my recent vegas weekend...just to relax and see some cards. ended up leaving a few hundred to the good from a $1-$2 nl table.  

good experiences always at the wynn and encore.  shuffle up and deal!

enjoy!!!",5
"this place was so adorable! we took my little sister here for her 10th birthday and she had a blast. i had a lot of fun myself with the animals. please, please give places like this a try instead of taking your kids to chuck e cheese.  you won't be disappointed.",5
"service is top notch, food is mouth watering, prices are very reasonable. perfect for a romantic dinner, or get together with friends!",5
"i ordered the kimchi, pork ramen and dumplings. the ramen was good but not worth $15. the kimchi was disgusting and i had to throw it out. there was way too much vinegar...i guess that passes for kimchi in pittsburgh. the dumplings were good but reminded me too much of the frozen kind that you buy at restaurant depot in the strip district. if they were homemade, they somehow figured out how to clone the frozen ones that taste nasty. total bill was around $40 delivered....not worth it. will not order from this place again.",2
"oysters aren't in season so they don't offer oyster shooters, instead you're given half shell oysters and limited to 1 order per person.  the nigiri was not good at all, the salmon was mushy and my uni was a dull orange.  the rice to fish ratio was also off, too much rice for a small piece of fish!  i also noticed that a majority of the rolls had a garlic sauce that i wasn't too fond of after a couple rolls. and they only offer 1 piece of mochi per customer, they wanted to charge $1 extra for another piece of mochi, usually ayce sushi places don't care..  

other than that, the baked green mussels are the best here.  and i enjoyed the baby tako very much!  i'd recommend the vampire roll as well!",2
"this place has some serious potential but hey aren't quite living up to it! they have a distillery right next door and they highlight those liquors in their cocktails but they could have so much fun with those spirits instead they only have 8 cocktails in their list. several of the cocktails lack creativity as well. then there's the food menu which i think they shouldn't even both with it because it's only a few tapas that are mostly shrimp. they were out of the sausage balls and with such a tiny menu there's no reason to be out of something. then there's the wine list which only has 2 reds and 3 whites! overall they are just way to limited! 

this could be a cool place to hang out with friends but i hope they make some changes. they have been open for a year and should have some of these kinks worked out. 

wagon flight and shrimp dip were ok. nothing to write home about.",3
this location is on point i don't come to mcdonald's often but i do have to say this one is pretty outstanding through the drive-through. always so fast and really friendly. it's a great location.,5
"this place is gorgeous! stunning stunning stunning! very alice in wonderland.

if you're hungry and looking for real food this is not the place - they have a real food menu but it consists of tiiiiiny expensive portions. 

this is the perfect place for the girlyest outfit in your closet - the incredible shoes only another fashionista would appreciate, frills, a great skirt...and afternoon tea. or their chocolate fondue. order lots of water and a pot of herbal because all their desserts are so rich that you will feel the cavities beginning. 

their macarons are incredible! 

and use the washroom, it's pretty.",3
"we have been going here for years, but tonight was the last night for us. we had a call in order, after 20 minutes we showed up and the owner let us know they hadn't even made our pick up yet.  there was 1 other table. once we got home we realized it wasn't even our order she gave us.  when we called to have it corrected the owner was rude and did not want to correct this matter. we drove back and got the correct order but the owner was rude when we got there.  what happened to customer service? it has been lost at this establishment.",2
"went here a few years ago for my friend's birthday dinner. got the surf n turf, and was forever changed. i dreamed about going back to this place, soooo good. i'm not a big seafood person, so the surf part of my meal wasn't my fav, it tasted like lobster, and was a little too chewy for me, but that's why i really don't like lobster. it comes on a bed of lobster mashed potatoes, that are my fav.

the next time i came back, i ended up having this place two days in a row, once when i treated my friend for her birthday and then the next night we went again with her family. i must say, it's not cheap, but for special occasions, it's worth it. we got comped dessert both times for both birthdays, the donuts are serious crack, like needing rehab for. i recommend getting the wine sauce for your steaks, it's the perfect touch. service is impeccable, and people are excellent at their job.",5
not worth the money; nothing about this place says or taste like louisiana. started with the chicken wings which were flavourless... moved onto the steak which was equally as bad.... finished with the apple crumble which was ok.... girlfriend had the ribs and and ate a grand total of two ribs off the two racks before boxing it up to take home to our garbage compactor of a son.... like another reviewer said just go to the kfc (and i hate kfc).... place sucks.,1
specialized in duck and chicken. it's something different and it was super tasty. will be coming back again.,5
"yep, i am a fan and a big one at that!  been here many times and always enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere and the prices are in line for chef wolfgang puck's name on it.  

the wolfgang puck bar & grill in the mgm grand, serves a contemporary ""bar and grill"" menu artfully executed.  the restaurant has an exciting bar and a beautiful glass enclosed private dining room.  

i always have a personal gourmet pizza, no you can not have any, it is too good! they are perfecto e mundo.

the fritto misto consists of calamari, zucchini, shrimp, olives and served with a lemon aioli, which is exciting to both look at and eat.  his wine list is primarily of california wines and the desserts are made in house. 

my husband loves their sandwiches.  the  peppered prime beef, with aioli and white cheddar on a baguette with potato salad  or the smoked turkey, ham and bacon club with herb aioli and baby greens are his two favorites. 

prices for sandwiches are between $13.- $16.00.  pizzas are from $12. - $14., so no breaking the bank here to enjoy a good lunch!",4
"finally found a place that serves amazing wings at a great price.  had the smoky buffalo, only regret is that i only ordered 6. the pizza exceeded our expectations and the pizza bread has gotten the golden approval of my 6 year old. great atmosphere, will definitely be back. go pack go!!!!!!!",5
was there with my family from out of town last weekend.   great food.  biskets are the best!!  great bbq and sausage was the best.  we will be back!!,5
"this target has gone down hill since their grand opening 4 or 5 years ago. the staff are rude and have attitudes partly because management does not hold accountable to higher standards. hoodrats pass though the parking lot and harass for money or ask what you be about? (gangs) managers refuse to have security patrol outside and told me their security is only to protect the customers and merchandise inside the store. the area is ghetto, but wally's immediately 2 blocks to the east manages to have nicer staff and a safer parking lot with about 10 plain clothes and uniformed officers handling the parking and inside the store.",2
"i ate here on a quiet tuesday night. restaurant was 20% full max. the yard and neoghboring restaurants that are part of the complex 40%...

this smaller restaurant which is part of fox's yard is very nicely done. its not overly large and it has a very nice open kitchen with an oyster bar etc...

service is super friendly 6\/5

quinoa typical fox quinoa with added greek yogurt - yummy 5\/5

oysters tried three kind - only the expensive one was exceptional - other were on the salty side(i was warned) if you really want oysters, you may as well buy the expensive ones...they are worth it! i think they are from british columbia... they are the large honey colored ones!!

shrimp 4\/5 

salmon entree a bit fishy 3.5\/5

certified angus beef burger didn't care for the bun nor the rings  4\/5

ny steak 3.5\/5 (steak was not that special)

i did try to order the signature dish (loup de mer) but they ran out (fish) it could have made the diff to a 5 star rating?

drinks 4\/5

strawberry ice cream dessert 4\/5

this place is on the more expensive side, i would repeat, but i cannot give it a 5 star rating, just yet - like i have given many other fox restaurants!

the yard concept is altogether a 5 to me!",4
"this store seriously needs to expand to a bigger space.  floor to ceiling bikes (3 high), merch hanging from every conceivable part of every wall.  if they stuffed any more items in there, you wouldn't be able to get customers in.  as it is, good luck standing next to someone, you'll have to go single file through the whole place.  

with that said, good selection of bikes and gear, prices aren't out of line, and the people are friendly and helpful.",4
garbage service. i was very disappointed in the lack of communication. all i herd was come tomorrow.,1
"living up to the hype, there are many things that i loved about lux, and other things that i would warn newbies when coming here:

pros:
* their coffee and baked goods are pretty tasty. i got a chilled mocha and it was the right kind of chocolaty and the right kind of caffeinated-buzz. i also got a croissant (because i saw one next to me and immediately decided that i wanted it) and it was fluffy and delicious.

* the coffee shop is huge, so it allows you to find a chair, nook, couch somewhere or if you come with friends you can all hang around together in some corner. the store has different spaces so keep looping around if you don't see any free spots at first. 

* the music selection is quite cool and makes the ambiance pretty happy and chill. the decor is funky so there is a large combination of chairs, tables, sofas for every taste.

* it turns into a bar, well, its always a bar but you can go for both coffee-drinking time or boozy time. i have not had their drinks, but they have a cool bar setup and a large selection of fresh ingredients for (hopefully) a successful execution.


con:
* its effing pricey. for reals, its not a ""round the corner"" coffee shop so assume that your coffee price includes everything from ""ambiance"" to ""the price of being seen"" to everything in between.

* the music. its loud. if you are here to study, well, don't. i came here to read (not knowing any better) and i struggled with a mixture of how loud the music was (even tho i liked the selection!) and the even louder dumbass sorority girls next to me chatting their lives away. this place is social, not a shelter for your quiet-needs. let me repeat that:

this place is loud. do not come here for peace and quiet.

* parking. the lot is always (always full), so expect to park on the street wherever you can find. this can sometimes be a challenge, but they have 2hr parking on the street and some back lot, which i am not sure if we are allowed to use.


so there it is folks, the good, the bad and the not-so-ugly. i am ashamed and happy for giving into the hype and trying this place out. i'm not a hipster, a coffee-snob or anything, but i do love anywhere with great quality food and drinks where i feel welcome. isn't that what its all about anyway?",4
"it's a treat to take my son here to practice his mandarin and order items in the language.  what's more noteworthy is the consistency of the meals.  they make the noodles onsite through a window where you or the young ones can watch and there are choices.  what i enjoy is that there is around 40 choices limited to a few types of dishes and your. it overwhelmed with 1000 items that are impossible to quality check.  

today we ordered the steamed dumplings (a favorite), slices beef stew (see pic) with amazingly tender and quality beef and noodle and egg roles which are delish.

i rated a four because there is always an awkward aroma when you arrive which makes the event somewhat difficult at first.  the other reason is that i find the noodles to be a little bland but that may just be preference not quality.

note: no adult beverages served and very family friendly.",4
this is a pretty sketchy place. there are always homeless people sitting on the steps outside begging for money as they (mostly) block the entrance. the other day there was someone with an obvious mental disease that was randomly yelling at a customer who was sitting trying to enjoy his meal. it didn't even seem to phase the staff as they did nothing to extinguish the situation.,1
"first time at this wingstop. been getting their wings for years at other locations and just discovered this one near work. 

ordered online and order was right on time. ordered the eight piece combo with fries and a drink for just under $10. got original hot and louisiana rub. 

the fries were good but, as with all fast food joints, they give you the fryer leftovers so my basket had some loser fries. too bad. 

the wings were very good. the original hot were a bit slight of sauce but not too much. the rub wings were perfect: crispy, juicy and a good amount of rub on them. 

the counter service was excellent and efficient with a soft up sell on the drink, since i paid at the store. 

overall, always good wings but fries are a crapshoot when you take them to go.",4
not such a great experience when i was here. wait staff cleared plates while we were still eating and ignored us while bringing drinks to other guests. if i ever go back the review may be altered to reflect a better or worse experience depending. so far i don't see a reason to go back.,2
"excellent beers and a short list of bar food. they also have some meads, which are excellent. the ambiance is cozy and inviting.",4
"after getting into an accident that caused pretty significant damage to my car last month, i found las vegas collision center. they are one of our insurance company's preferred places to go, so it was a really seamless experience. i was really upset about this accident as my car is brand new (i had only been in it for two months) and i was terrified it wouldn't be the same afterward.

not only did las vegas collision center have amazing customer service between jazmin at the front desk and all the guys who answered my many questions, but they finished my car over a week early, during the holidays. they even changed the oil even though the oil area wasn't damaged, they just saw it needed to be done and took care of it. 

when i went to pick up my car, i started crying because they had done such an amazing job. it looks brand new again and drives the exact same. you can tell everyone there truly takes pride in their job and want to do right by their customers. i highly recommend las vegas collision center and while i hope i never have to come back, this will be my first choice if i ever do.

thank you to the amazing staff - you guys made a very difficult time a lot easier and i can't thank you enough.",5
"a secret. a hidden little gem in an upstairs shopping mall food court - of absolutely delicious indian food. all of it, including sauces, made by the chef owner. he's got that glint in his eye of someone who likes to cook and he is talented - great combination!

""do you have lassi?"" i asked, not seeing it on the menu. (this is a lightly sweetened yogurt drink.)

""well...i'll make you some."" ...and off he went, coming back in a few minutes with the best i have ever had!! just, ab so lute ly perfect. i couldn't believe it. i almost cried.

at that point i had to try more than what i had ordered - getting a little bit of tandoori chicken, various sauces, spinach, curry, -- all of it, all of it really, really good.

my only complaint was the naan. it was tasty, but not made fresh, made in advance and re-heated. but come on, this is a shopping mall indian food place. the other flavors more than made up for it and i did visit at about 3:00 when they were cleaning up from lunch.

in any case, i am coming back with an appetite, they had some lamb that looked delicious.",4
"my a.c. went out yesterday...when i called and asked when i could get an appointment, the office girl quickly looked at the schedule and told me that ceasar would be there between 1 and 5. at around 1 o'clock i received a call from ceasar informing me that he would be there in 15 minutes. ceasar was fast, efficient, and professional the entire time. my a.c. was back and working within 2 hours. they do the entire invoice on a ipad and everything was emailed to me, including a quote for a new a.c. excellent service!",5
"definitely my favorite pho spot in cleveland. cheap. delicious broth. very fresh vegetables. the banh mi is okay. i would not recommend getting the bun bo hue. it tastes like they used the pho broth with it. with that said, their pho definitely fulfills my craving whenever i'm missing home or just craving vietnamese food. love the casual atmosphere that other pho restaurants lack.",4
"busy drive-thru, but quick service! just tried their molten chocolate frappuccino... delicious! :) whoever the gentleman was that was working the drive-thru was very polite & you could tell was well-trained in customer service! i just moved from seattle & each of the starbucks in washington state that i've been to (... at least 25 different stores...) just radiate happy & positive vibes -- this one reminded me of home! bravo! i will definitely be back to this starbucks because of the polite service!",5
"avoid this place at all cost. i'm a quiet middle aged man and got kicked out of here for complaining to much about my noisy neighbors blasting their bass music all hours of the day and night.

if the noisy living conditions get to be too much you can always go for a walk in the park across the street and pass the time by watching drug transactions.",1
"be careful when ordering! apparently, they put roe (fish eggs) on everything but don't specific whether it comes on it. i ordered sashimi and it came out with roe.",3

"i'm notorious for abusing my muscles in my shoulders, neck, and back from long hours sitting at my computer working.  when my muscle spasms set in or my migraines, i'm forced to go see my favorite therapist, harold.  this guy knows his stuff.  he finds all my knots and works them out.  before i leave he reminds me of the exercises i should do periodically after an hour on the computer.  just bought my foam roller here tonight so i can stretch my back out.   if you want to book harold....he is in demand, so book ahead.",5
"i love this place. they deliver on a trendy cool place to eat, very broad selection, and everything's good. i've been going here for close to a year to have brunch and i always walk away feeling well fed, never gross or bloated.",4
"it's been yeaaars since i ate at this location and it's still good! i used to go to the wynn location a lot back in the day, but this one seems newer. this location has been open for a long time now and it still looks like a good environment to dine in. as far as food quality goes the two locations i've been to seem to have the same taste. they have never disappointed me as far as their food, but the real take from this place are the prices. everything is pretty cheap and they give great portions! my girlfriend and i were able to share an order of pad thai noodles and beef jerkey. she also got an order of their thai tea. we spent less than $20. i remember i used to get their bbq combo you find on the back of the menu. it comes with sticky rice and papaya salad. that was always my go to. the servers were welcoming and i can tell they've gotten to know a lot of the regulars there. i forgot how good this place was for a quick thai fix. definitely will be back.",4
"well in the past week i've had two salads and a panini. i had bought two groupon coupons and was very excited to try this.   i didn't have a problem with the price but with the quality and taste.  really,it's hard to screw up a salad, or a sandwich but nothing was very appetizing and actually threw most of my last salad away.",1
"what a wonderful little hole-in-the-wall restaurant in the northwest corner of las vegas! as many other yelpers have posted, i've seen this place rated consistently great for a long time and figured i'd give it a go. so glad i did! 

the proprietors were incredibly friendly, and my food was absolutely fantastic. 

i ordered the falafel plate and dolmathes (stuffed grape leaves). fresh, tasty and cooked to perfection. 

the restaurant is clean and inviting with a few tables if you care to eat in. i chose to take out, and if i waited 5 minutes for my order i'm overstating. just wonderful, i can't wait to go back and try more items from the menu...next? gyros. yup.",4
"my absolute fave burger joint in vegas! i know exactly what to expect when i come here. double bacon cheeseburger with a slew of toppings - i love that they do grilled onions and mushrooms as a topping, as well as the classics like pickles, lettuce, tomato. i love that they have 2 size options that are both incredibly filling. the strawberry shake has delicious chunks of strawberry which i enjoy. service is always friendly and it's great to see your food being made fresh. love the bun and and quality of all the ingredients. for a classic burger with a large portion size - this is the spot!!",5
not cool waited forever the waitress threw the kitchen under the buss all through service. food was ok but they need to space out the tables wait staff is overwhelmed,1
"let's talk about the parking lot.  the flow of traffic in and out of the lot is better than i would expect given how segmented the lot becomes with all of the curbing and landscaping.  the landscaping is nice, but lowe's should spend a little more time on the maintenance of the landscaping; as customers walk across these areas the mulch wears away to nothing, exposing bare ground.  c'mon lowe's you are selling us dreams of perfectly manicured lawns and landscaping so you have to ""practice what you preach""!  because of the maintenance i have to give 4 stars.",4
"this was the absolute worst so called ""chinese"" \/ ""thai"" i have ever had. the quality of the food was very poor and not well tasting at all. the only good thing about it was the price. five meals for $45. i guess you get what you pay for.",1
"i was disappointed when they gave me the sale price for my return on a known defective item that they put on sale since it was defective (wallflower night light).  in these cases when it is known to be defective, they should exchange at full price.",2
"ok so here is only bad reviews so i went to see myself if it is true. so everyone is different and it depends if you go with time or not. i went there the lady told me ""someone called and booked the bed for certain time if they don't show up i'll put u in."" i waited like 7min and it was all fine! 
now the place doesn't look brand new but it was ok to me.. so i did my tan and i left :)",4
"service is horrible. we got in pretty quickly and sat at our table for about 15mins until we finally decided to ask who are server was and still took another 10 mins for our drinks. probably will not return to this location even though it's 2 seconds from my house, i'd rather drive the 20 minutes to the other location for the service even though they have a longer wait time. great customer service equals business.",1
"being a chinese i want to say this is the most authentic chinese food i found in pittsburgh. their chef are from sichuan. they don't cook with those market salty and sweet soy sauces like many the other chinese restaurants do. all the flavors are natural, house made; ingredients are perfect. even though they are a little pricely, their food, service and place worth the value you pay. don't miss their bbq choices. ask for the chinese menu or ask the chef to cook in real chinese style... you will have the food exactly taste like what you will have in china.",5
"i was introduced to this place by my cousin, and man was it good and all-you-could-eat.  everything i had was tasty.  i highly recommend the sashimi salad (or whatever it was called, it is raw fish salad) with spicy sauce.  wow.  i want to come here everyday.  the only con i have, but not to ding it a star, is it gets crowded, so get there early!",5
"certainly the best buffet i've ever had, and probably the second best meal i had during my entire vegas trip.

we visited wicked spoon for brunch, and for a pretty decent price (i believe it was in the $35 area), you had tons of options at your disposal from classic breakfast fare to more ""interesting"" options. how many other places can you get french toast and pancakes with green pea pasta carbonara and goat cheese panna cotta? 

every dish i had was excellent, but there were a few standouts in definite need of mentioning: don't miss the angry mac & cheese, or any of the pasta dishes for that matter. double up on the ratatouille, go nuts with the shockingly good sushi, and save room for the full gelato bar with mini-sized scoops to ensure you can run through their stellar selection of desserts. the high rating is well deserved.",5
"came here on my lunch break with a co-worker. since we only have a limited amount of time for lunch, we called ahead and put in our order for a certain time. when we got there, our food was ready and waiting. 

we got the 20 piece mild wings which cost $14. we asked for the wings to be extra crispy on the outside, which they didn't disappoint. the outside was nice and crispy but the insides were moist. the wing sauce was good. not a ton of meat, but decent for the price. i'd say comparative to buffalo wild wings. 

we got there at opening, so we were the only ones. the place was nice and clean and organized. note: this place has an a- rating from the health department. restroom are small and look like they've not been cleaned in a month!! at least the men's is that way. 

will definitely come back again and try out other items on the menu.",4
"imagine the mounting tension and excitement of walking terminal c with enough time to find a sit down restaurant and enjoy a leisurely lunch before your flight.  then peiwei appears like an oasis in this desert of junk food.  this is such a great feeling.  they have a nearly full menu to choose from, also a great sign.  

well that concludes the good news.   the food was mediocre.  i got the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.  the veggies were barely ok, the chicken was as dry as the sahara desert, and the rice would have had more water content before being cooked.  the massive quantities of sauce could not rectify the problems and instead added to unpleasantness of this meal.  

the only things on par with a regular pw would be soda and fortune cookie.  

i'd opt for the fast food if i were you.  their low rating is sadly well earned.",1
"very intimate, amazing little restaurant. 10 tables in the whole restaurant. dinner was amazing, homemade pasta, fresh bread, great service, overall awesome experience.",5
"on tap: this location has 130 tap handles! we were so impressed with the huge variety. they've got tons of  local and regional beers, some of which were featured in their ""chalkboard series"" of rotating drafts (fat head's holly jolly, great lakes brewing co's christmas ale, willoughby brewing's nut smasher, and founders brewing's backwoods bastard). they keep their (hundreds) of kegs in a glass-enclosed room upstairs that is visible from the bar area, and the bartender said they check their tap lines on the reg. 

the vibe: swanky, yet not too downtown feeling. wide open spaces, dark & shiny surfaces, plenty of funky art and fabulous music. all three times i've been there, the playlist has been great. of note: the bathroom door has an automatic opener, so you don't have to touch anything after washing your hands- love that!

the eats: i've been delighted with all the food i've tried! what's been best includes the gardein menu's ""chickn"" and avocado sandwich, garden buffalo wings, gardein orange peel chicken (ask for the fried rice as a sub for the brown rice, which is top notch), and the gardein ""chick'n"" bbq salad. also worth trying are the hot & spicy edamame and hummus. my husband loved the pineapple chicken (from the specials menu, located inside the drink menu- not in the regular menu).

the service: all three times we've had awesome service. the 2nd time we were there, we had a large party of 7. the manager walked us around the restaurant to find the best table. he made sure we were happy with our seating. that was impressive. 

i work less than 5 minutes away from the new westlake yard house, so will definitely try their lunch menu soon.",5
"remember when you read other reviews that many are trying to recreate their childhood.  i have no doubt this was probably once a nice casino, but please find another place for your family.  we visited this past december.  luckily for us we were in the rv park.  because once we went into the casino we were appalled at the condition of the casino.  there was a chemical smell permeating the place (we were told they have had insect problems, i do not know about this, but really makes me wonder what that smell was)  and the smell was overwhelming.  
the dinning spots were overpriced, and again we wouldn't have eaten there if you had paid for it.  now let's talk about customer service.  customer service?  well first they have a skeleton staff and service is minimal.  perhaps there employees were all home sick from the smell?
we frequent a lot of casinos.  we live near reno\/tahoe and have plenty of indian casino's where we live.  so we feel like we are somewhat experienced about what makes a good casino.  one of the high priority's for us is good security.  well don't look for that here.  besides the rowdy folks stumbling through the casino at a high percentage, there is the matter of the security at the tables.  hah!  husband was playing 21 and was verbally accosted by a player who was not happy with his play.  the other players rolled their eyes at this individual.  then the man became very aggressive and told my husband ""fight like a man and let' go outside"".  where was the pit boss?  security? according to the other players this man had been going on like this for quite a while.  this would never happen in the better casinos!
we met a couple from europe who were also in the rv park. i asked them if they were taking their children in for the rides etc.  he said emphatically no!  he said  he had gone in to check it out and did not feel like it was a safe place for his children.
again there are so many cleaner safer places in las vegas to take your children, pleas do your research.",1
"great food, ambience, service... i tried the fried chicken and sweet potatoes. both very tasteful (not magical though). lemonade was not the best. i do suggest this place for take-out as they will pack your order on a picnic ready basket with everything you need. i did not try the bar but it looks good. next time i will call ahead for my order and enjoy it in the park across the street on a perfect picnic set.",4
"my fiance and i have been here several times and we must say we love everything about this place.
from the staff and owners who are always very accommodating,friendly and knowledgeable...
to the ambiance and finely appointed decor and contemporary casual atmosphere in this hidden treasure it is worth the finding.
each time we have gone we have order something different.they offer daily specials or try something off the menu,you won't be disappointed. don't see something you like or want to tweak something you see just ask and they will prepare it for you.
we enjoy the out experience so much we are planning to hold our small intimate wedding reception there!
yes...they do parties,events and catering.
this is a must experience rare gem hidden right off the parkway east and pa turnpike!

my goodness i sound like their pr person...hmmm
maybe i will go in for dinner and discuss.lol
enjoy!",5
"heaven. seriously, this is the place to go if you want to pamper yourself.

a couple of friends and i purchased the groupon deal posted a couple months back. we got full facials and spent the rest of the morning relaxing by the pool. the staff is very helpful, and since we were first timers, we appreciated the directions they gave us.

the spa is beautiful, and i love the variety of teas and little goodies. the facial was amazing and super relaxing. i wish i brought my swimsuit to enjoy the pool, but it was (almost) just as good laying in a robe and enjoying the sun next to the pool. the smoothies were made with fresh, gorgeous fruit, and well worth what i paid. i expected to be disappointed but the quality was remarkable, even for a smoothie. they also had a yoga class going on, which we peeked at but skipped. again, wish i could have brought my yoga pants so i could attend the class. there's always next time!",5
"was a little bummed they didn't serve alcohol considering the name.. and they charge $32 for a full set when i can get the exact same thing at a nail salon that only does nails (no hair or massage) for $20
but janelle and the rest of the staff was super nice 

3\/13 one of my nails popped off
3\/18 second nail popped off",2
"the chicken, goat curries are the things you need to order here. don't order biryani's it is not worth it. their fish fry was good. i didn't try their buffet but i heard it was alright. the curries were more close to the south indian cooking style, so expect more oil.",4
"if we hadn't read the previous reviews we would probably have been quite disappointed. but our exppectations were well managed and with a buy an adult admission get a child's admission free we enjoyed a nice change of scenery for an hour and a half.
sea life is dreaming if they think the regular admission price matches the value of the experience. the shark talk was pretty lamely delivered and included a blanket statement that ""sharks are an endangered species"".... perhaps true for specific species of shark, but i doubt the kid deliveringthe talk would understand the difference between genus and species. also when we asked what other names the ""mexican lookdown fish"" also went by (because it looked familiar to us but we had never heard the name mexican lookdown fish before) he had no suggestions. however...at least he was making an attempt to discuss the animals on display, unlike the two kiddos manning the tidepools...think ""omg im so excited for my play tonight! my costumes all over the backroom because i totally have to finish it on my break!!! like totally!""....ugh.
all that said, if you have a 2 for one and you're looking for a change of scenery for an afternoon and you are willing to lower your ideals for what an aquarium is about....go. but go forwarned.
also...no conservation message? but a request for some random charity called merlins magic wand for which there is no obvious mission? the most specific statement made was ""makes kids smile""...okaaaaaaaay.",3
"i went to ej for a long time until i decided i couldn't justify a $50+ haircut.  the service was outstanding and the haircut was great.  kelly took her time and made sure i was happy with the way it looked.  she was easy to talk to, intelligent and skilled.

if you have the means i suggest giving them a shot.  the $50+ includes scalp massage, hand massage, shoe shine and beer.",4
"i know this place is not high art, but the food's pretty good and the price is right.  i probably stop her a couple times a month and grab a carry out box.  the variety of sushi is pretty good, but i normally go for the more simple things anyway.  i've said in a other sushi reviews, i understand the workmanship of a deep fried, glazed, crab sparkle roll with honey almond aioli, but i like sashimi and avocado rolls.  anyway, the hot foods are ok too.  for a quick, inexpensive grab and go, i'll keep coming here. for date night sushi there are more appropriate places scattered about town.",3
"sad. i know people have bad days. but i walked in, no one was in line and got nothing. no smile. no greeting. the guy behind the counter was more worried about scraping the lettuce off the cutting board than greeting me or taking my order. the guy who adds toppings. same thing. i move up to the register, and still nothing. 

so i keep walking. out the door i went. next door to them was a new restaurant called soulfish poke. looks like i have a new favorite lunch place.",1
the ladies that run this store are so friendly and they provide great customer service. i'll def be back for more baby gear.,5
"this harris teeter has food lion on eastway looking almost like whole foods, and that is just sad.

first of all, the parking is just unsafe. with awkward entrances and a poorly lit lot to the side of the store, i make it a point not to go after 8pm alone just because of the lack of light and recent incidents involving young women and violent men hiding in\/around their cars in this parking lot at night. and don't just think it's me being ""scared of the neighborhood"". i live in plaza midwood, find it a great, safe place as a whole but you can't expect me to walk out to my car, away from the street, with no lights around!

the actual store itself is just a holy mess. the vegetable\/fruit area is missing items right and left, but the deli counter is the ultimate nightmare, placed facing the ever crowded bread aisle and stuffed with center aisle displays (krispy kreme, etc) that just make it flat out impossible to a: figure out who is in line for ordering sliced meat, b: get out without someone hitting you with their cart (blame the aisle size, not the drivers) and c: finding boar's head meats. sadly, this place only carries d&w and let's face it - there's a big difference in quality. i'm not sure why harris teeter hasn't converted this store to boar's head, but it needs to hurry up - the area has changed it's demographic over the past few years and it's not adapting at all.

other gripes include the confusing checkout area as another yelper noted, as well as the crowded entry way in and out of the store. the only upside? the location!

despite the closeness to my house,  i'm now doing my shopping at trader joe's (love love love the place, hate the parking @ the met!) and food lion (largest meat selection and great sales on white meat). so here's my message to harris teeter: step it up in my 'hood! i understand what you thought plaza midwood was - a neighborhood no one cared about, that you could give poor service and selection to and no one would speak up - but it ain't so either change it up or lose the neighborhood to trader joe's forever....",1
"don't waste your time!  the dump is overpriced.  there are no deals.  i walked through the whole store and was astonished at the  prices!!!!  you're better off shopping retail, the prices will be the same and the quality will be better.  the aggressive salesperson was just doing his job and if he had something decent to sell me i would have bought it but there is nothing but junk there priced way too high!",1
"best family restaurant in all of arizona. fabulous food, awesome service,  great atmosphere and super pricing and portions.  love, love, love black bear, it's truly my favorite place to go, breakfast, lunch & dinner and especially homemade desserts!",5
food is amazing and love how they play soft live music . the owner is so nice to his customers and came by the the table asking how everything came out. chips & salsa are so fresh i always order the chimichanga  and it never disappoints. this place definitely deserves a good rating.,5
"great wash\/awkwardly pushy sales

i had my first wash here recently and i came to conclude two things:

1) great job washing. i have a black truck and it looked great afterwards. 

2) salesman too pushy! after i declined his ""once in a year"" sales pitch, he turned back to it after a few more sentences and explained it further. no big deal, i declined again. then as i'm out of my car and trying to head inside he starts trying to sell it again!

once. ok. twice with another explanation. sure- maybe there is something to it i wasn't considering. a third time is annoying and too much. the way that he did it all with a smile reminded me of a used car salesmen. 

management: stop with the high pressure sales.  

i will most likely be back but my patience for this will grow thin shortly and i may be the guy chewing out your employee for bugging the crap out of me and not accepting no.",4
"cool location. drinks are good and reasonably priced. they seem to have a nice variety of beers on tap along with bottles and cans. the arcade area is fun, though it's easy to blow through a few dollars in as many minutes. live music is another draw for this place. haven't eaten here but friends say the food is great.",5
"this place was horrible, even with fun friends! it is like a bar out of mexico. i did not like it. they do have a live band inside and patio tables & benches...other than that....it sucks.",1
"almost a full year later and we are still so thankful we found the dukes back on that hot, sweaty summer day. our ac unit is still going strong and we are looking forward to a stress free summer! thanks again, dukes!",5
amazing! bottom line. we've been using another company and not seeing results and more scorpians than before they started! having a 10 month old at home i started my intense research on other options.  thank you all for yelping about green machine and helping me find them!!! cory came today (and stayed in contact to let me know his eta which is a huge plus) and already the results are 1000 times better than our last 4 months with the other company! quietest night since we moved here!  he is so knowledgeable and incredibly detailed...we were absolutely stunned and impressed . he didn't just spray...he had different tactics for certain areas...he had a science to it.  the whole family agreed this was by far the best decision and so thankful for his hard work today. we look forward to doing business with them and thank you thank you thank you again!!!,5
"this is the most fun and family friendly event we have ever taken our children and now grandchildren to! friendly staff and great performances by absolute professional circus acts. you can depend on your little ones being entertained as well as my wife and i every year getting wowed by the performances. this is a great way to spend time with family and it's a must do every time they come to town. clean environment and clean entertainment, what more can i say!",5
i was so happy today i walked into pizza fiamma at 2:30 and he was so happy to help me ! i am pregnent and my brother has told me about this place but i always use to order pizza pizza !!! and today i order pizza pizza at 1:15am i was craving pizza i don't like to drive at night alone has my husband works nights and im alone and have to leave my other son with my mom so i order food and they didn't knock they called me at 2:05 once my phone was on charge i called back 2:06 and i called back 10 times no reply and they were late and i gotno food so i thought i had to eat something i didn't want until i seen and ate pizza fiamma ! off it was amazing i had tandoori chicken and medium spicy !!! best pizza in town and the owner was such a sweet guy he gave me 3 pops for free for trying first time and telling him my story ! i will never call pizza pizza again and also upside pizza fiamma no delivery charge i live behind pizza pizza and they charge me 4.00 bucks !! i hate pizza pizza on worthington in brampton !!! thanks pizza fiamma !,5
"not bad, not bad. it seems like everytime i mentioned anything about ""this (any) food store on the danforth"", the immediate reply is ""the big carrot?"" 
come again?

oh, okay. the big carrot *is* like a more righteous version of whole foods. i was pretty freaked out by the fact that everything was organic, that the grapes were 5$ a pound and the bread i looked at was missing ingredients that i had believed to be necessary to make it bread (ie. flour and gluten...whatever that is). they should legally be forced to come up with another name. 

anyhow. it is a very nice and shiny and earthy (but in a shiny, man-made way) store that will presumably leaves its customers looking nice and shiny and feelin' earthy. in stores like this, i am always amazed at how calm and happy people look to be grocery shopping in places like this; the aura of pleasantness that permeates every employee, customer and earth\/body-friendly item makes me wonder if organic food really is, in fact, magic food.  certainly a different experience than the one i regularly see\/get at the dufferin mall no frills.

p.s. i had been wondering if happy planet smoothies had gone extinct, but i saw them here for the first time in ages. in giant size, no less.",3
"for $7.00 the corned beef hash was a major disappointment.  one spoon of hash and they put the bread on the side so you don't see that you got 1\/2 plate of food for exorbitant prices. food was freezing cold. sausage patties had weird taste that i cannot quite put my finger on. if you want a good hot breakfast,  you're better off going anywhere else!! beware!",1
"good food, prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are exactly what you'd expect from a chinese restaurant.  i came here for dim sum and was very happy with the food.  the service is ok, not the best, not the worst.  i was taking my folks out and wanted to pay so went to the cashier to pay but they had to grab the order sheet from the table.  then i had to stand in a specific place to pay for the bill.  literally the guy told me to take 3 steps to the left and 1 back.  and had me wait there.  it was really weird.  but besides that the food is really good.  their bbq pork is probably the best in the city (bold words).  but its really moist, soft, and the glaze is done really really well.  its been 2 days and the leftovers still taste good.  another thing to try is the bbq pork pinapple buns.  something unique and becoming more popular in canada, but so far the only place i've found in markham.",4
"awesome first visit! staff and dr. tran were very friendly. went in for my issues with acne, dr. tran was very understanding and explained my tx plan moving forward, walked out excited and confident to clearer skin.",5
"happy accident. 

with only an hour before an appt at the nearby hospital, hubby and i decided to have a quick bite and drink. wandered up on a saturday during tiff and arrived at 645 not knowing where we were going but menu looked decent. the hostess was fantastic about our tight timeline, as were all the staff. as we were seated (ironically beside all the citytv personalities decked out their tiff-party wear!) we suddenly realized we were woefully underdressed for the venue (think pajama pants and yoga gear) but were treated superbly nonetheless. they promptly brought a nice selection of breads and butter, water and our drink order. 

we each had the short rib burger which comes with bacon, gouda, sautéed onion, tomato and lettuce on brioche and your choice of frites or salad (we did one of each). burger was delicious- juicy and flavorful. frites were tasty, salad was mediocre, just greens and a pretty boring vinaigrette (the server did warn us of this). $17 for meal each. i also had 2 glasses of a tasty house shiraz ($10\/glass-generous pour) and hubby had a pint of steamwhistle. total bill $70, plus a generous tip....because the service was outstanding. every staff member went out of their way to be professional and it ran like clockwork. they were so accommodating and had us out in 40 minutes but still somehow not rushed feeling. as a bonus, there was a jazz pianist playing softly. 

i'd say food was 3.5 (hard to really judge based on burgers) but the service was 5+ so we will definitely be back to check out more of the menu.",4
"my girlfriend and i went there for lunch today. when we walked in it  looked  nice enough . we asked the waitress if the food was good and she said that it was. i ordered the fried chicken at her recommendation and my girlfriend ordered a hamburger patty and french fries. the hamburger came out medium well even though she ordered it medium. i ordered the fried chicken which came out very crispy and very dry. so all in all we were very disappointed. the high point was the french fries, they were great as was the coleslaw. we probably won't be going back.",3
"it took me a while to write this review, but better late than never, right? 
i just want to take this opportunity to thank the guys at i am mechanic for a wonderful job they did on my car. i had 24 hours before i relocated to another state, and needed the car fixed asap. these guys did just that! the guy that i was dealing with ,his name is noë, he was the nicest, funniest, kindest guy! we got along like a house on fire over the phone already. which was a great relief for somebody who was going through such a stressful time, as you know how it is when you're about to relocate. the last thing you need is for your car to break down! before he even quoted me a price, noë we guaranteed me that they would beat any price that i had already been quoted by other mechanics. that to me was everything! long story short, my car was towed from the dealership to i am mechanics that very same day and i got it back the following morning. i could leave that same day but i just needed one more night in vegas to enjoy and to drive around, you know? to test drive the car! so that's what i did and the following day, i drove 5 hours from vegas and no problems at all. in fact , it felt like my car was brand new. and just in case you were wondering, the problem was a drive shaft in my suv. they didn't replace it but they fixed the one that i had and they gave me the cheapest price.
so, thanks again to noe, i really appreciate it. 
ps. i also got 30 day warrantee on their work . iit's been 4 months since they worked on the car, still going strong. a million thanks!",5
"i really do like the food however, the service is awful. if you do not speak the language spoken behind the counter you will generally not be served in order of arrival. (based on three experiences) secondly, the location is not entirely ""clean"" the floors and counter tops are filthy every time we have visited. 

the price is very fair and the naan bread is fantastic but i really wish you didn't feel so stigmatized trying to order your food. 

the food does sit out for a very long time and the pastry that comes with the thali is simply disgusting.

owner seems very friendly and tries to build conversation but the women is simply rude and will not even bother asking you what you would prefer. 

you know that seen in most children movies with the lunch lady who serves awful food in slow motion..... something similar to that.",3
"brandon is the best in ontario if you ask me in gel nails.  i have done the exact product, bio sculpture gel nails across the province and no one does them as well as he does.  i moved 2 hours from toronto and after two attempts to get my nails done there in the area, i ended up back at brandon. i would make a bunch of appointments in the city and drive all the way in knowing the reason i was there was to get my nails done.  
when you first go your only thought is going to be ""it's not the prettiest place"".  when i first went i was a little disappointed because of that.  i wasn't sure i would be back for a second time until brandon did my nails.  i knew instantly i wouldn't go anywhere else.  
i've had pedicures done there too, they were good.  in keeping with anywhere else i've been and the price in line.  i've also had brow waxing done, same thing, perfectly fine and prices in line.
truly you go here for brandon or any one of the nail technicians trained at his side.   i can't recommend him enough.  in fact, don't listen to me.  if you go then he will get busier and i will lose the ability to see him as regularly as i do.",5
"after reading reviews on the long lines at bellagio, we decided to get there early for lunch. the line moved quickly and we were able to take advantage of the breakfast price right at 11am. i was disappointed the restaurant did not look upscale but was not disappointed with the food. it is the only buffet out of four we ate at that served freshly squeezed orange juice. because we like our meat well done, we asked for our flank steak to be well done, and it was the best steak we have ever had, it was marinated just right. we would be happy to go back to bellagio just for that. even though it was lunch, many breakfast items were still being served the whole time were there, and slowly replaced by lunch items. for the quality and taste of food and service, i would give it five stars. the only disappointment was the desserts. they looked better than they tasted which was not a good way to end a meal. all in all, the quality of food and service were what i would expect from bellgio. even our 15-year-old daughter enjoyed it so much she kept asking us to go back during the next three days we were deciding on our dining options.",4

"i bought the groupon for monkey bar gym and i was extremely nervous (as i am not a particularly fit person), and now i am definitely going to get a membership. 

when you first sign up they require you to come in for an initial consultation. they will show you around and give you information about how the classes work and what to expect etc. this is a great time to ask any questions you may have and learn how the facility runs so you don't feel so lost on the first day. the trainers recommend a plant-strong diet and encourage all participants to log their workouts. i had my initial consultation with raquel. she was amazingly helpful, and encouraging. it was nice to know one of the instructors before i had even taken a class! 

they post the daily workout on a whiteboard so you can check it out before class starts. they also have a binder that has all the workouts for the month, if you like to look further ahead. the workouts change all the time so you're never bored. monkey bar does a wonderful job of explaining\/modeling how to do each exercise. they make it a point to go over every exercise you will be doing before participants begin the workout. the whiteboard also has a section that is divided into ""stability"" ""strength"" and ""power"". here they have suggestions for modifications\/challenges for participants who want to tailor their workout. the trainers are always helpful when it comes to finding an alternate exercise. 

the trainers and members at monkey bar are very friendly. they ask you to get with a partner for some exercises and i have had no trouble finding a partner and striking up a friendly conversation with them. members often say encouraging things to one-another during the workouts as well.  one day after the workout i was getting a drink and a man (who i believe is an owner, or at least another trainer i hadn't met) asked me if i had recently joined. i told him yes and he enthusiastically welcomed me. 

overall, monkey bar is great. the workouts can be very intense but i always feel invigorated afterward. great experience! :)",5

"my italian dining curse has broken!

trattoria italia is located in the location formerly montesano's.  its easily spotted from eastern with plenty of parking.  going with a fellow yelper stefany means i'll be trying more than one thing.  i always say yes to that!

we decided to start with the eggplant ripieni.  great decision on stefany's part.  it's a bubbling baked dish resting in sauce and covered in cheese.  the sauce is flavorful and goes well with the complimentary garlic knot basket.  this appetizer is fantastic! 

for the main attractions we split the special of the day mushroom risotto and the orecchiette. the mushroom risotto is incredible.  the huge dish of risotto was creamy and delectable.  i didn't want to stop eating.   but since we had another entree so i had to.  

the orecchiette is served with broccoli rabe and sausage.  the buttery pasta was combined with plenty of sausage and broccoli.  again this was a giant dish of food.  we had plenty to take home for a second meal.  

dessert? they have a case at the entrance filled with plenty of tasty treats.  i was feeling quite full but couldn't say no to a cannoli.  but instead of the large i went with a mini cannoli.  the cannoli is fresh and indulgent.  the shell was crisp with no sogginess.  yum! 

to top off the amazing food, we had wonderfully attentive service.  she was good about keeping up with our water intake.  it was a great experience and i hope to be back soon for more!",5
"yup...must go back!

really, there are so many things on the menu that sound outstanding i have to hold off my final review until i get a chance to try more stuff.  i have been to mellow mushroom 3 times now and loved everything about it each and every time.

great beer selection, awesome food, fantastic atmosphere.....love it.

hopefully i will get to go again soon.  did i mention i love this place?",4
"just had an amazing one hour session with kim (but every time i've come has been great, i've just been lazy about getting a review up). the space is incredibly calming, and my body is always much better off after a visit. kim also gave me some stretches for my neck which i really appreciated.",5
"just as good as the location on eastern ave. plus a little better in my eyes since the patio is a little nicer at this location. now if they could only open another location closer to my house so i can have delivery. i would give them six stars for that.

 i do find it funny how you see a lot of californians come out just to eat the pizza here. i do sympathize since its impossible to open a new coal pizza oven joint in the golden state. (from what i have heard). on second thought maybe i don't since we need the tourists.",5
"i have a very hard time believeing this place warrants all of the high praise.  maby the dining in experience is better.  my review is based on a catering order of breakfast burritos that my company did.  the burritos were poorly labled and was difficult to tell which ones did not have nasty chorizo in them.  the burrito i had a bite of and spat out was a salty, greasy mess.  of course i picked a burrito with chorizo.  so glad i did not waste any calories on this.",1
"i've read the reviews so knew pretty much what i was in for. kind of like going on a roller coaster for the first time but knowing what to expect because you spent months talking to your friends about it.

i thought the experience was pretty cool, perhaps ghoulishly cool.  we parked around the corner, and once we were on the street we walked right past it.  there isn't a sign or anything but because of all the pictures on yelp i recognized it just as i passed it.  we walked in, and right into what could be an art exhibit.  or a garage sale, depending on your point of view.  even the bathrooms are loaded with stuff.  other restaurants that use pieces of americana as decor are mere imitators of this place.  the zenith is the real mccoy. 

now about the food:  i was there on a saturday, and had the wheat berry salad.  it was large, and filled me up.  it tasted good and i was pleased with it.  i will be back to try other items.",4
"i've only tried desserts here and let me just say... my eyes rolled back into my head and i briefly lost consciousness. 

the treats here are that good!",5
"miss korea needs to staff up.  the last two times i've been there was one girl working the entire restaurant.  even two is not enough.  she was busting her butt to keep up.  some people left in frustration.  food portions and recipe were not consistent between visits.  no banchan provided.

will give it one more shot.  if they don't improve, its likely i wont return.",2
"i've lived in cleveland, ohio for a year now, and i finally went to the zoo. wow, it's impressive! the exhibits, for the most part, are beautiful, really well maintained, and appropriate for the animals. the landscaping is absolutely gorgeous with trees, flowers, and foliage from all over the world. i greatly enjoyed learning about  everything i saw! i strongly encourage everyone to visit this wonderful zoo. thank you, cleveland!",5
"came here with some friends before going over to casa loma for an event. till this day, i still think about the chips and the guacamole (i can see it's very popular). anyway, the service was above and beyond considering we went on a very busy evening, and even though we didn't have a reservation, they were able to seat the four of us. the waiter was very attentive, our food arrived on time (i order some beef rib tacos and they were absolutely delicious. i can't remember what else my friends ordered but i remember they all enjoyed what they got very much) and the overall atmosphere was lovely and cozy (on a busy night it can be a bit cramped, it's not a very big place). 12\/10 on experience. i would love to go again to try their other dishes!",5
"place is fantastic, always get great service and the food is always awesome.  falcone was awesome, friendly, personable and took the time to make us feel welcome.  we really enjoyed our dinner.",5
"nice employees, clean, neat store. knowledgeable employees, not so much. i asked where in hardware hasp locks would be. 1 employee never heard of it, 1 didn't  know, and 1 did his best to help find it. we found them, in a couple sizes and 2 different finishes, all in stock. they were a bit cheaper at walmart supercenter (west mifflin), but were out of stock in the size i needed. too bad, too, because they had some heavy duty ones under $3. 

to be fair, i guess all employees can't be expected to know exactly where everything is, and to gave heard of everything, especially hadp locks  (not something one needs often, or at all).",4
"went to pieology after hearing many good things about it from my brother who lives in california and has eaten at the chain quite a few times. 

when we arrived, the place was still rather lively despite being a half hour before closing on a weekday. the employees were very friendly and kindly made our food for us. even though we had arrived close to closing, they put no pressure on us to ""hurry up and get out"". we were willing to take our food to go but they insisted that we dine-in if we preferred. 

we paid about 9 bucks for a custom bbq chicken pizza that my boyfriend and i split. it was very tasty and the only thing i didn't like was there was too much bbq sauce around the edges, which made things a little messy. regardless, that's an easy fix and i'll make sure to point it out to the person making my pizza next time. 

overall, a very fun, cheap, and tasty place to go to if you are in the mood for pizza and don't want to share. my favourite part of this experience is that you can get as many toppings and cheeses as you want. my friend got every type of cheeze they had to offer. it was insane...and delicious.",4
"came in here with boyfriend on a friday night with a reservation. we were early so sat at the bar for a drink - generous pours for sure! then we got taken to our table. i asked what the soup was (clam chowder - amazing) and the whole time the server seemed to have an attitude about him with every word. actually, when he walked away, i looked at my boyfriend and said ""so he's a bit of a pretentious fuck, huh?"" boyfriend wholeheartedly agreed. it became comical at that point and we had a laugh about it but i could see another group getting offended. back to the food: the oysters and dessert (german chocolate cake) were forgettable. the soups (clam chowder and french onion) were outstanding, as were the entrees - my 8 oz filet was cooked perfectly and boyfriends 16 oz prime rib was incredible. overall we would absolutely go back.",4
save your money and go somewhere else. looks like a 5 year old kid groomed my poor dog. definitely left her with a hack job hair cut.  waste of $40. i need to take her somewhere else just to get her haircut even.,1
"before my first appointment with angela i tried contacting her with some questions i had and she never responded to my text messages or called me back before my first appointment with her.  at the first appointment, she told me i booked my appointment the wrong way... well, if she would have contacted me prior to meeting in person, all of my questions would have been answered and i would have known what services to book.  she told me that everything was online and i should know how to do it.  when you see a client for the first time like me, there are questions they may have before they come to see you.  she is rude, not responsive and then told me some things about my hair that was a total guess, she had no idea what she was talking about.  she also told me she doesn't answer text messages on her days off?  i texted and tried to call her two weeks before my appointment.  that's just bad customer service.  i am not going back.  waste of time and money and i don't want to deal with a rude person doing my hair.  go somewhere else for your time and money.",1
"definitely one of the better hamburger chain that i have ever ate.  the quality and taste is to die for.  the only reason i gave 4 stars is due to being too expensive for a hamburger.  one regular shake shack hamburger $6 did not fill me up.  i need to spend approximately $12 to fill me up.  that is pricey for eating hamburger. i also had the strawberry shake but kinda pricey for the amount they gave me.  i prefer the west coast in n out burgers over the nyc's shake shack for the price and amount you get.  by the way, go cuse!",4
service was  very slow and the food was just okay. the menu options were limited and the biggest surprise was the menu prices went up on thursday and friday for the same exact menu items.  we ate there every morning starting on a monday and checked out friday!,1
i really liked this urgent care. this isnt a place to go if you have chronic pain but if you have a sudden onset of symptoms they work great. my family and i come here every time!,5
"we loved this olace! buddah chicken, snapper, tao temple salad. so good, foodgasm wothy. sam, our server was so good too!",5
this was my first time going here and i absolutely loved my eye lashes! very full with great length! recommend going here over any other place!!,5
i love everything about this restaurant. it is always crazy busy but that's how you know it is great food and very friendly staff.,5
"this place owns in terms of decor and that oldie diner feel (booths are awesome). 

on the other hand, the food is just meh at best. granted, i've only had breakfast here a few times, so perhaps my review is limited to those options. they bring you decent portions of beans, toast, bacon, tatos, and 2 eggs for $8, but the quality is mediocre, and the dish just looks messy. coffee is drinkable. for the price, and in downtown toronto, it's actually a great value, but it really could be just a taaad better. 

if i want to get an inexpensive, quality american diner breakfast, i'd rather go to high park's grenadier cafe, where there's a similar meal for $4-6, and a huge patio where you can enjoy views of the park. glad i tried out the senator though!",2
"called these guys after 10am when they open while driving into vegas looking for tickets to tournament of the kings tickets.  got them for $55\/pp which was 25% off as advertised, they also respectfully tried to up sell me on other things by asking where i was staying and how long i was in town. i asked about buffets and they had 30% off mirage cravings buffet coupons for $2 each, i was a bit leery but i figured $10 is not huge and yelpers seemed happy with this place so i got those also. quickly picked up tickets at the giant coke bottle when we got to town, well staffed and friendly and told me how to handle excalibur tickets, etc. bottom line, i saved $128 on two venues for 5 people. enjoyed both of them very much as well.",5
"easily the best sushi in toronto. always fresh, fast, friendly, and delicious. miso soup is always spot on. salty, but subdued. everything is always available and tastes great! my favourite sushi place.

basically, the owners are a quaint woman and her son. the son talks to us a lot at the table and shares his sushi experiences. a really charismatic guy that knows how to treat good customers. 

the teriyaki sauce is brewed for 7-8 hours every day. the chicken teriyaki is absolutely delicious, and the sauce is perfect. i would definitely recommend it in the bento box. everything, the rice, sprouts, noodles, is steaming hot, delicious, and super fresh. 

every roll is tightly wrapped, and plentiful with good ingredients. they have an excellent menu, but it's not too huge. a good size that offers variety and good flavour profiles. 

the rolls span from cucumber to oshio house special rolls. my favourite roll is the oshio special. i would definitely recommend it, and the rolls are large and very full. i can usually eat 1 and a half rolls, or 12-14 pieces. 

the ambience is nice, clean, and tastefully lit. the sushi can also be seen as it's made at a small sushi bar with about 4 seats. 

they use fresh kikkoman soy sauce, and amazing wasabi and ginger. delicious! 

the seating area is not usually full. kind of empty actually, but the reason for that is due to their take out options. usually, people take out to eat at home as opposed to stay. overall, i would definitely recommend this place. delicious sushi.",5
"this was defiantly one of the tastiest juice places i've been to! the atmosphere is inviting and very cool. the service is quick and the bowls and smoothies are very tasty. the only down side to the place is that the prices are a little high, but for a treat every once in awhile it is worth it.",4
"fast food, great sushi, great atmosphere. been looking for a good sushi spot since i moved here several months ago. this place is by far the best that i've come across since i've been here.",5
a fantastic oasis in the desert of bad food and drink plaguing americas airports. stop in for a nice glass of wine and a delicious salad accompanied by a good playlist.,4
"i've been there couple times because it's close to my work. it's funny how there's around 6-8 people working there and they mess up orders when there's only a few customers. the portion also varies time to time. i also think that they are over-priced especially the burgers. 

i got an e-mail saying that i have a free shake\/smoothie. i went there and was told that it no longer apply to you because you installed the new app. however, i got the e-mail after i updated the app. i was pissed so they gave it to me at the end. however, that's not professional.",3
tried their burgers because of the hype and totally not worth it. such a disappointment. burger was less than average and priced way too high for the cheap quality and lack of taste. i gave them 2 stars because their customer service was awesome but other than that it would be only a 1 star.,2
"new shawarma place in an area that has 90% chinese restaurant, 75% population are chinese, and about 99% of them don't even know what shawarma is.

banner hanging outside saying ""lunch special $5.99 \/ 2 shawarma $6.99 halal""

they do have a small sign that is in chinese saying ""middle eastern roasted meat wrap"" (in direct translation)

the shawarma i got was a bit smaller then i thought it would be, i guess it's their size is smaller. good thing is it's stuffed with chicken and vegetables.

the garlic potato was deep fried potato quaters and then cover with some garlic sauce and hot sauce. (not roasted potato)

could be better, but in this area, not bad for a quick fix.

no credit card, just debit card. (or cash)",3
"there's a pet cemetery here! 

i mean, pet relief area. it's called ""the bone yard."" it's a bit creepy with it's depressing steel cartoon picture of an dog and cat gate at the entrance. 

i think arizona is a bit morbid. if you visit papago park, they have a tomb site of arizona's first governor, george w.p. hunt and other family members. it's like a local attraction or something. 

that's the desert for ya.",4
"no wonder this hotel was featured in the movie ""vegas vacation"". between the jungle feel of the casino, the mini-volcano out front and siegfried and roy (rip), this hotel - the first of the strip mega-resorts - has enough hokey strip personality (now almost a cliche), to fill ten thousand coin buckets.  the last time i stayed here was five years ago, and i understand from others who've stayed more recently that it has deteriorated but the parent company, mgm mirage, is planning major renovations.",3
"lots of potential

open for less than a month, the cuppa is a cool new coffee spot in the gramercy plaza off of russell near fort apache.  currently, there is a ton of construction going on russell road so it's only one lane in each direction.  i exited the 215 and had to turn around at fort apache to get here, but once i was here, it was fine.  however, i had a short visit because i arrived 30 minutes before they closed on a friday afternoon. 

right now, business hours are monday-friday, 6:00am-4:00pm, saturday and sunday, 7:00am-2:00pm.  hours will probably be extended once business picks up per charlie, the tall, personable barista\/cashier.
i ordered a small mexican spice.  charlie said that right now they're the only food place in the plaza, but dw bistro and pinches tacos are going to be arriving, as well.  i can see how this place probably get more action earlier in the day from the businesses in the complex.  

i liked my drink and the chat i had with charlie while i was there.  lots of seating available in a nice, open space.  they offer pastries, cookies, bagels, sandwiches, along with coffees, smoothies, and teas.  the also offer free wi-fi if you want to plug in while you sip or chew.

for my first, abbreviated visit, the cuppa is definitely a-ok in my book.",3
"like many have said this joint was surprisingly ordinary for a place featured on the food network, but a couple of items are pretty mindblowing and the good news is that you can pick them up in a case right by the register. curious?  i'll save the best for last and start with our appetizer that we had to try after hearing guy fieri rave about it - the spannakopita. lots of spinach and the first i had ever had with dill, but it really worked!  for the entree, my waitress was raving about the chicken slouvaki so i gave it a shot. pretty solid. my wife had a blt and fries. safe choice but solid again. now is where the real fireworks happened... 

on the way out we passed by a glass case i had already eyed on my way in and we couldn't resist the temptation. ordered a slice of carrot cake and two pieces of baklava. both items were best-in-freaking class and were devoured as soon as we got home. they make each daily and you can tell. the carrot cake had lots of goodies (coconut, raisins, etc) and the icing was great. as for the baklava, the best i have had, and this coming from someone whose childhood friend was second generation greek whose mom made fresh baklava weekly. 3 stars overall, but 5 for that glass case!",3
"don't be confused by the name or the cool atmosphere, this is a great gastropub. the name it turns out, is a rolling stones....kinda cool.

me and my coworkers made the trek across the bridge from downtown to the danforth after work last tuesday.  my coworker had been there several times before and said it would be worth the walk.  we were seated immediately by the very friendly and warm hostess who stopped to chat with us. 

we started off with an order of ahi tuna tacos and an order of pulled pork tacos. both were flawless and went well with the headstock ipa we ordered. we had fish and chips, factory chicken, a burger and a maria pizza, all were delicious. the factory chicken is prepared differently than any other chicken i have ever had. it was so moist and delicious and the veggies that came with it were perfectly al dente, it is the type of dish that you will crave. 

the waitress suggested a lovely and reasonably priced wine to go with our meal. all in all a great experience. i highly recommend.",5
"visited madison for just 5 days and came here for bagels in three different occasions. best bagels ever! handrolled, freshly made, delicious. so many options to choose from. and that pastrami... oh that pastrami!",5
"i started out by calling morris jenkins about my damper motor being bad and that it was under warranty as my unit was less than 5 years old.  they told my they don't warranty parts.  so, i called one hour air.  

will beard was my service tech.  he was at my home the same day on time and very respectful.  he took the time to listen to me explain everything, went and verified that it was the damper motor gone bad.  he also verified the part was under warranty and that would i just was responsible for the labor costs.  he took the time to also explain their service plan as well without any ""high pressure"" tactics.  thus, allowing me to make an informed decision.

i had to leave for work so we had scheduled for the next day for him to come back and install the new part.  will called about 45 minutes before arrival to make sure i would be home and again was right on time.  he replaced the defective part, tested it.  and explained the warranty on the new part.  

overall i am pleased with one hour heating & air.  and, will beard provided a positive experience, excellent workmanship, and great customer service.",5
"this place looks like a dump from the outside, but don't let that fool you. i've heard several people refer to it as ""the best mexican food in madison."" i have yet to eat anything there that wasn't excellent; but the tacos and the carnitas are my favorites, along with the homemade horchata. (mmm... just writing about the food makes me want to drop everything and go there for lunch!) the atmosphere is very casual, the service friendly, the prices reasonable. one of those hole-in-the-wall joints that more people should know about.",5
over priced and not worth $200. i love going to spas and have to say the deep tissue massage i recieved was one of the worst. the women i had doing my massage was rough and did not lighten up when i asked her too. she did not focus on anything i asked. she was coughing and sneezing all over me during the massage.,2
"absolutely hands down the best sushi place in vegas , amazing service , awesome staff and very fresh !! always love eating here !",5
"music choices are great if u choose one of the rooms, not to mention the happy hour prices are amazing. the vibe outside of the rooms are even better. brought my nieces here to sing while my sister who was visiting from seattle hung out in the bar area with the awesome employee. thanks jayden for making my sisters 1st experience here an amazing one! we will be back for sure!",5
"way overpriced and there's a safeway right down the street from this location.  this location, as well as the one on washinton st., think they are in times square, new york city and can charge whatever they want.

they forget that this is the valley of the sun where people hop in their car and will drive 5 miles just to go to a dairy queen.

so if you want to save some money, go elsewhere.  the locations are convenient, but it doesn't justify how high their prices are.   $12+ for a dozen ""organic trash bags,"" is ridiculous.  $3+ for chapstick?  $7.99 for mediocre deodorant?   get real cvs.",2
"super disappointed. yes the restaurant was busy. the waitress took our order, then we didn't see her again until our party of four was 1\/2 way done with our meal, my son walked over to the bar and retrieved his own soda refill. i kept the evil eye contact until she finally came to our table at that point i let her know that our order was incorrect and my food was cold. her initial reply ""i'm busy",2
"food is always good and the portions are huge. staff is friendly and decor is very nice, but it's a bit loud.  if you are looking for family dining, it's definitely a much better option then the eat n park or bob evans nearby.",4
good sushi but they need to pack to go orders better as the toppings are always stuck to the cover. also the quoted pickup time is never accurate (show up 15 minutes later than they tell you).  i'll be back though since it's the best in the area with many of the specialty rolls being very good.,4

"historical?  yes.  
incredible views?  absolutely.  
one of a kind?  pretty much.

i'm glad i did this on my tour through pittsburgh a few weeks ago, as the views were incredible.  i started my trip at the top though, so i had already taken a ton of photos prior to boarding the trolley.  i didn't really get any shots that were much better than what i had seen from the top, except for the requisite ""looking up from the bottom of the line"" photo.  this seems like one of those attractions that is worth going to once and then marking it off your list.  it's a fairly fast ride up\/down the hill and was actually very smooth considering the age of the attraction.  while we were here, the new batman movie was being filmed across the river at heinz field, so we did get an interesting viewpoint to see that.",4
"the barker lounge has been a great experience for me and my dog. they communicate daily over social media about spaces open, their website is user friendly, their staff is very friendly, the facility is very clean and the location is great for me - i work 2 minutes away!

also, while i like the idea of online reservations, and i understand their importance, i frequently can't book my dog during a given week because all the days are filled up.",4
"the southside libarary is recently revamped.  i ussually go here to get away from work at lunch and study.  its perfect for that or picking up a book.

it really is nice inside and the staff are friendly.",5
"the service was really terrible, the girl with the very short bangs kept staring aggressively at our table at two individuals and seemed to want to get a rise out of us. this was my first visit here and i have to say i will not be returning because the aggressive server\/hostess. i hope she isn't like this with other people because it will surely make other guests at the least uneasy.",1

i found the service and attention was perfect. the attention to detail and quality of the food was outstanding.",5

"i went for lunch here with a few colleagues for my birthday and it was delicious!  we shared a spectrum of  oysters to start.  they came with all the fixings. i particularly liked the cilantro glaze. we had a great bottle of grayson cellars chardonnay, and there is something just delightful about oysters and white wine that can't be topped. i ordered the tuna blt for my main.  it is a seared yellow fin, maple-miso glazed pancetta, panko fried tomato, with wasabi creme fresh.  my friends had the scallops in the butternut squash risotto, and they thought it was fantastic.  the waitress brought me a chocolate brownie and ice-cream, which was on the house, to celebrate my birthday.  i was overjoyed and stuffed by the time the meal was over. overall a great experience.  it is a bit loud in there, so it would be tough to have a business lunch with more than two people there.",4
"the food was good. i had keema nann, samosa, and a keema curry. it all tasted great. i thought the service was a bit rude and lazy.  i was standing out in front of my hotel waiting for them. i missed one call from the driver (who was not there yet) because my phone only rang once. i then got a nasty text from the manager saying he tried to reach me multiple times to say they were on the way.  i called them back to say i was already out front waiting (even though they said they would just call when they got there). when the driver arrived he did not even bother getting out of his car. he just honked his horn at me to come over and handed me my good threw the passenger window. i did not even have a chance to top them.",3

when we arrived at the venue, we were told that we would not be able to do the chef's table as that took over 2 hours. since we were still sort of stuffed from lunch, this was sort of a blessing in disguise. instead of stuffing ourselves with a 5-course dinner, we got to snack of decadent cured meats and cheeses with a nice bottle of wine .",4

salmon festival combo

meal set made for 2 or more hungry individuals. however, soup and salad will be served for assumed 2 individuals. 

combo includes: 
14 salmon sashimi - freshly cut, buttery salmon which tastes amazing with or without soy sauce \/ wasabi.

12 sushi pieces - ymmv. we received 4 torched salmon, 4 char roe, and 4 salmon sushi. the torched salmon was a nice touch, but the char roe sushi takes the cake with the flavor overwhelming your taste buds if not taken in small bites. recommend combining with other things on the platter. 

salmon festival roll - deep fried shrimp tempura, cucumber, avacado, and imitation crab meat topped with torched salmon and char roe. lightly sauced. combination of these items tasted well and the char roe added that extra flavor when they pop. tempura could have been more crispy which would have added to the overall bite of the roll. 

salmon and salmon skin tempura with homemade spicy sauce. the homemade spicy sauce was not too strong but that was perfect for matching the salmon sashimi bits. the salmon skin tempura could have been more crispy but over time the sauce will soak into the skin bits. however the overall taste was well received. 

6 piece spicy salmon roll - they did not serve this item today but rather substituted their roll with an assortment of other rolls including standard spicy tuna, cucumber and california roll. we didn't catch this until after we looked back at the menu again. but regardless the rolls still tasted good. point loss for not sticking to the menu. 

comes with choice of spicy salmon or crunchy salmon roll. total of 2. as well as choice of seaweed or green salad. total of 2. and 2 ice creams. if ice cream is out, they will substitute will yogurt drink.

the seaweed salad was quite refreshing while the green salad was fairly standard. the spicy salmon roll was filled all the way throughout the roll and so you can finish the roll without running out of salmon. 

portion size was very large and more than enough food for 2 people. 

staff\/service rating - 4 \/ 5
staff was very friendly and answered questions happily, but with only 1 staff member serving customers. the store itself only seats about 30 at most and is maintained well. staff will go around and pour tea for you and refill it as needed. they can be found fairly easily but may get overwhelmed if busy. 

environment rating - 3 \/ 5
the store itself faces the street versus the parking lot so it's easy to miss. they do their best to maintain the cleanliness and extra attention is paid to their washroom facilities to keep it as clean as possible. nice touch on using a screen to hide cleaning supplies. however given the age of the store, the facilities are not as up to date or as clean as it could be. 

price rating - 3 \/ 5
price after tax   - $75.00 for the combo which could have fed 3 people. if you compare it to an all you can eat restaurant, it is expensive, however for fresh and authentic experience this is a standard price point.",3
"read the reviews and was intrigued. wanted to go someplace nice but not over the top. 

made reservations for 9 on a saturday night. arrived to a small line. told her about our reservation. she robotically told us to go to the other line. once i was in the fro.nt of the second line, another hostess gave me one of those square light filled waiting thing. felt kinda like chili's. all hostesses seemed overworked and none really smiled. it seemed they were all overwhelmed students doing this for the first time.  eventually a hostess led us to our table. asked her how her day went and she said it was busy. i thought to myself, but it's sat in vegas. is this something new?

upon entering, you see well decorated interior. everything in the place screams paris sophistication. dimly lit amber chandeliers hang from the vaulted ceilings. decorative windows w colored cutouts. marble tables. the place looks like a million bucks. decor is a comfortable elegance. everything is beautiful yet approachable. perfect for a romantic dinner.

i ordered the special of the night, prime rib served w potatoes au gratin and sting beans. cj ordered the seafood platter. a combination of lobster, oysters, shrimp, tuna tartar and seaweed salad. food came relatively quickly. was all as expected. taste was ok. 3\/5. which was a little disappointing considering the ambiance. platter was also $24\/person minimum 2. considering, it was very little food for the price. was more ice than anything else.

wait staff was also peculiar. waiter walks by. makes eye contact. then continues walking by. 10 minutes later he turns out to be the waiter. now at chili's a chain restaurant, they would have typically said ""i'll be right back"", or otherwise indicate they were our waiter.  he was cordial and informative though. food as said came out as ordered. but minutes later he is refilling our water. after a round or two, a bus boy finally starts refilling our water and removing plates. overall the feel is poor staff training and disorganization. this place has one of the best locations across from the bellagio fountains.

overall, great ambiance but food and service like a national chain restaurant. a shame because this place could be so much more. save yourself money and have drinks or dessert here",2
"definitely worth checking out if you have enough time.

i guess this is an older side of vegas, the hotels look a little dated but fun. it would be a cool place to visit at night, to see all those signs lit up and the light show on the roof. we had to visit during the day, but it was still worth the trip.

we spent some time at the golden nugget and walked up and down fremont. they have a zip line that takes you from one end to the other, there are plenty of performers, some better than others, and plenty of restaurants and casinos.",4
"to quote the owner\/manager: ""no, we do not have soy sauce!"" 
me: ""hahaha... oh, that wasn't a joke.
        but you are a dumpling restaurant, right?""
owner: ""soy sauce never goes with dumplings (insert his major eye roll)""

what? i mean i am a major dumpling fan and have tried many different kinds in montreal, ny, tonroto's chinatowns, and this is definitely a first. who doesn't mix soy sauce, vinegar and chili with their dumplings? or is it just me..  

so, that pretty much sums up the service. lots of attitude and peculiar dry sarcastic responses.

besides this, the place was cute, tucked away just off mont-royal & papineau. i quite enjoyed the eclectic design and furniture. if i had to describe it, it would be somewhere between a dep, a take-out counter and a restaurant. you can either eat here or grab some to go (they even sell frozen dumplings). 

prices are very affordable, which is nice. 

we ordered the ginger minis with peanut sauce, which were delicious as well as the duo (chicken and pork), good but not mind blowing. minus the soy sauce situation, the food was all very nice. 

all to say, it was good, so i' d probably go back and will definitely be buying more frozen ones.",3
"not the most ""legendary"", sorry, bar in champaign, but was my favorite. comfortable, good deals, good crowds on ride the rail nights and for big games. also, in my opinion, best burger of the campustown bars. this will be the bar i always go back to.",4
"my 1st time staying here.  our room was comped thanks to my friend who enjoys gambling.  haha.  anywho, our room was conveniently located close to the elevators and ice machine.  

the room had 2 queen beds and a large bathroom which included a bath tub, separate shower, 2 sinks, and the toilet behind a closed door.  the room is clean and decently sized.  the beds and pillows were comfortable as well.  noise level from the hallways is very minimal.  

i would stay here again... the next time my friend gets a comped room.  lol",4
"if you're anything like me, seeing that a mattress store has a ton of 5-star reviews (all mentioning the same person) will make you a little bit skeptical. and skeptical i was, until i picked up the phone and called carlos. i'm a pretty careful purchaser and went into the call with a litany of questions about a particular mattress' material composition, the densities of each layer of foam, the number of coils, etc. he patiently answered each one without ever getting annoyed. after i tried the mattress and decided i wanted to purchase it, he arranged delivery the next day, offered me a very reasonable price, and told me about a coupon deal they had for a free pillow (which is also quite comfy). i appreciated his attention to my needs, and willingness to go above and beyond to make this mattress purchase for me. if you're a thorough, detail-oriented guy that wants to hear tangible, useful specifics about a mattress instead of some wishy-washy sales pitch, give carlos a call.",5
"i went to this starbucks because the one on the other end of the mandalay bay was packed full of convention folk.  this starbucks is located towards luxor and had no line.  

we picked up our expensive $8 and change breakfast sandwiches and $6 coffees.  they tasted just like any other starbucks.  of course casino starbucks have higher prices, but to some people it's worth it to pay for convenience.",3
"i know ""what happens in vegas stays in vegas"" but this place is too damn good not to mention !

so, what so ""eggsellent"" about this place?? 
- friendly service
- large portions 
- big menu
- free parking
- quick service

the list can go on and on cuz this place is so ""egg-mazing!!!"" however, let me tell you one thing you must order is the ""banana nut muffin"". order one or a dozen to go, trust me!

though the place is a bit off the strip but it is totally worth the drive, totally!",5

"i described my first experience with this shop as good, yet a little chaotic and unorganized.  at first i thought it was just because they were busy...but i now have a sneaking suspicion that the staff just isn't very bright.  i recently called this shop to order a very small flower arrangement for a cake (think the size of a corsage).  i was going to email the lady i spoke to a picture of what i wanted.  when i asked what her email address is, she said ""bellagracefloral.com."" i said, ""no, not your website, your email."" once again she said ""bellagracefloral.com.""  fast forward 10 minutes when i'm still trying to explain to her that there is a difference between an email address and a website.  somehow she solved that brain buster and she asked me about my budget.  her response was ""for under $50 there isn't much i can do for you.""  she didn't ask any specifics about what i was interested in before completing writing off my request.  i decided to make my own arrangement and it cost me less than $15.",1
"the staff was very friendly - and the waitress we had you could tell have worked there forever, probably since they opened. the restaurant has potential and could be cute since they have a ton of sports memorabilia, but it just felt old - and not in a good way, like old, dirty and run-down. cheap fried food, dry ribs that do not fall off bone, and the filet was overcooked and dry as well. would definitely not recommend.",1
"wenn man in der markthall in stuttgart ist empfiehlt es sich auch das restaurant empore in der markthalle zu besuchen. der name empore ist programm denn man ist im 1. stock der markthalle.


 die empore ist ein großes, nett eingerichtetes italiensiches restaurant.
der service ist typisch italienisch schnell und freundlich.


 die antipasti im restaurant sieht hervorragend aus, ich hatte aber das tagesmenü. dies war ein pastagericht (garganelli) mit vorspeise und nachtisch für 17 euro. gericht war superlecker.
die qualität und frische der speisen ist hervorragend, aber alles andere wäre in der markthalle auch eine frechheit.


 auf jedenfall sehr zu empfehlen",5
really great sushi. really friendly staff. highly recommended if you enjoy sushi. little bit expensive but definitely worth a visit or two. i especially love the agadashi tofu in the appetizers. love everything else i've tried on the menu.,4
"mike and fredrick are great. my boyfriend have been going there for years. today we got a call to check out the cadillac ct6. when we arrived, mike was helping another customer, so fredrick stepped in to help us out. fredrick had a great attitude and personality. he was quite helpful. we took the car for a  test drive. played with all the bells and whistles. it was great. we will be back really soon.",4
the services are very unique. this locations is very beautiful. everything is elegant and beautifully decorated. i can tell the store is very detail oriented and organized as nothing seemed out of place and everything had a spot. it was all just wonderful to experience!! i will definitely be recommending,5
"it was about 5 am and i wanted some breakfast and tim horton's was 5 feet from my hotel. they didn't have the turkey sausage wrap i wanted so i got an egg white, turkey sausage sandwich, which really hit the spot. for a quick bite for breakfast, it was pretty good!",3
"not worth for $26.95\/ppl all you can eat sushi! 

very bad service,  food taste horrible and nasty, food is not fresh at all, oysters have weird smell. 

sushi come with huge rice but little sashimi, they gave us food which is not we ordered. and not allow us to order what we want. seems like they are trying to save money and trick the customer. 

never come ever again. such a bad restaurant!!",1
"this is a little gem.  sometimes it's best to do one thing and do it really well.  america's does carne asada really well!!  the meat is tender and flavorful and delicious!!  i had a carne asada burrito and it was probably the best i've ever had. but let me speak of the guacamole.....mmmmmm!!  if you like guac, this is awesome guac!!  it's got just enough kick in it and it is very tasty.  their chips are fresh and crispy and a nice compliment to the guac.  my daughter loved the cheese quesedilla and ate the whole thing.  when we got in the car to leave she said she wanted to come back the next day!  that's high praise from a six year old!

the shop is a cute little house with several tables inside and a nice seating area outside.  parking can be a little of a challenge.  there is only one way in and it's the same way out.  so if you're leaving and someone is coming in, well....you get the picture.  

the staff is always friendly and accomodating.  they make you feel at home.  the prices are reasonable so you don't break the bank either.  
thank you america!!",5
i think this place is awesome! found some great stuff and the guy was fair with pricing.,5
great sushi. the menu has a lot of different choices to choose from with all you can eat. i definitely always recommend this place to my friends.,5
"sunday nights, i don't get out of work until 10 pm. like many towns, there's not a lot open around 11ish unless you want to pay exorbitant prices on the strip, or eat fast food. 

well on sunday, 4\/17\/11, lawrence t., came to see the show i work for and afterward, we were in search of some food. having missed out on ken m.'s uye ""pizzas, peppers & pints"" and living too far away to come here by myself, i was dying to try this place because they serve ghost peppers and luckily, it's right around the corner from lawrence's apartment, so that's where we ended up going.

it was a ghost town when we walked in. there was one person in one booth when we walked on in. we were seated right next to the kitchen. i was torn when i saw the menu. ""chicken fingers in ghost pepper sauce or ribs."" it was a tough choice because i'd been dying for ribs for a good week now, and to add insult, my parents had went to lucille's bbq earlier that day with my youngest siblings and brought my sister and me back nada. the pull for bbq was too strong, and i ordered the ribs and fries ($19), and lawrence ordered the bbq chicken sandwich ($10)  topped with breaded onion strings, and macaroni salad.

we didn't have to wait too long for our meal to be delivered to us. the food runner switched our plates and seemed a bit surprised that no, the meat was my order. my ribs were good, but not fall off the bone. they weren't the memphis dry rub ribs that i love so much, they were smothered in some sort of bbq sauce. i regret not trying the ghost pepper... anything because common sense tells me i can eat bbq anywhere. lawrence took half his sandwich home for the next day but i assume he liked it.

our bill came out to $31.35 with tax, which is a little steep for late night food, but that's my fault for ordering ribs. would i be back, eh... only if i'm for sure going to order something with the ghost pepper, otherwise, nah.",3
"i needed to find someone to pick up and discard a couple of mattresses, old tv's, other pieces of furniture, and misc items. after looking on yelp, i found jdog junk removal. they have great reviews and is veteran owned and operated by a lovely family, greg, his wife tammy and their daughter. they recycle what they can, and donate items that can be used by someone in need. they are professional, very prompt, reasonably priced and the nicest of people. i would highly recommend them and would use them again.",5
"i have been here a few times because i work close and i haven't had anything good here except a spicey mc chicken once. the wait is excessive, multiple times my orders have been cold and once i tried their breakfast and i am pretty sure that if i had eaten the sausage it would have made me sick. i may try it again someday as these things happen but not any time soon.",1
"this place is great, with a wonderful staff.i had a wonderful experience taking my baby there and will be returning as well as referring! thank you for making my baby look like a puppy again!",5
"one of the best restaurants in vegas. i've been a customer since their other location on decatur. it's great to see a local family run restaurant and see the changes and improvements they've been implementing over the years.

i love their bulgogi fusion nachos with kimchi on top. the chimichanga is awesome too. the staff is great and the owner is always very polite and attentive. the prices are very good too. we walked out with a check for $22 for three people. not many places in vegas where you can get food from a local family for that price and for great service.

i highly recommend ordering from the fusion menu, asking for kimchi on top of whatever you get, and asking for the hot sauce that they bring out on the side (ask for it when they serve your food).",5
"food is great, love it love it love it.  the philla steak pita, the hummus, the mediterranean chicken salad, gotta love it.  wait staff on the male side is total eye candy, however, can't say i'm impressed by being called dude.  my waiter need some listening skills as he forgot my soda until i reminded him for the 2nd time.  maybe cuz it was cuz he was giving elevator eyes to customers and staff.  would give this place more but think the male wait staff needs to come down to earth a bit so we can at least have a decent conversation....dude.",4
"mwc is a relaxing place from the minute you walk in the door!  they offer yoga classes that fit into everyone's busy schedule and weekend retreats which focus on self care, and well being.  the class  and workshop\/retreat sizes are small so it's more welcoming and a more personal experience.",5
"this place is easily the best italian restaurant in the valley. 

the atmosphere is cozy. and yes, you will be seated near other parties, so if you are planning on having a lurid conversation you might want to choose another restaurant. don't make any loud inappropriate jokes.

i know rabi doohan iii has been here on more than one occasion, and i'm wondering how he coped having to spend a whole dinner session without making a loud inappropriate joke. i know for a certainty that if the two of us went and had dinner there, that we might rack up a complaint or two. anyway...

the food is top notch. i had the veal saltimbocca, which is hard to find in the valley. i highly approve.

the service was top notch. i felt right at home. the owner made me feel like i was apart of the family.

if you go here on a date(app, entree, bottle of wine) expect to spend anywhere in the range of $75-$90. if you want to pop in for an entree you can get out of there in the 15-25 range. well worth it in my opinion.",5
"best best restaurant in toronto!  expensive but worth every penny and best food and service ever!  there is nothing like this. also, best view in the city. i can't say enough good things. wish i could afford to go more often.",5
great customer service! the skin fades and tapers are legit. highly recommend for those who are looking to get a fresh cut. start here first before any other shop.,4
"after going through their fairly extensive menu, i placed my order. sadly the server came back saying they had run out of it so i had to pick something else. while tasty, the food was generally heavier\/greasier than i like. what really bugged me was that the description of the panini i ended up ordering clearly states it was chicken breast, and what came out was most definitely dark thigh meat. it is a good option for vegetarians and vegans though.
it is a cute place near the park. service could use a bit of improvement. the server was more friendly to some people than to others.  plus my date's dish came out significantly later than mine even though he ordered first since i had to place a new order.  i would give it one more shot and try something different (perhaps the dish i wanted will be available next time!)",3
walked in. ordered. got my food in five minuets or so. they weren't very busy. i got the food to go. i got the gyro platter. the food is awesome. would recommend it to anyone. there aren't many greek restaurants in town. i will definitely be back.,5
"heading out to the airport we knew that we did not have  to eat before we left. not wanting to stop at one of the many chain restaurants in the robinson area we decided to try this place for the first time. calling it's a diner is a little misleading, it feels like a upscale sitdown restaurant that happens to have booths and a counter. 

the menu is divided from classic american to mediterranean greek food. i chose to have the gyro platter, which was a gyro sandwich broke up into a salad served with as much great greek dressing as i could ever want. 
everyone at the table decided to have something different so we had orders of fries, burgers and panini's. to be honest there was not much talk about the food because everybody was too busy eating. the portion sizes are humongous and everyone had food to take home. i truly believe that this is one of the best deals as far as portion sizes in the city. all in all great service, taste and portion sizes. 
my only problem with the restaurant was that it was loud. we have a unique situation with having an autistic son who is overwhelmed by too much noise. we did ask be moved in they placed us in a quieter corner. it really helped and our son was able to relax and eat his meal. i cannot say thank you enough for doing that for us. 
we will be back in this possibly could be our restaurant of choice in robinson all the time.",5
"so here i go with my first review!! my fingers have been twitching to type from a long time. i start with maya @ k-town. 
i am blessed with a thin mane and there is nothing to brag about it!!it's a task where you need to find a right stylist all the time. a 'know-it-all' hair dresser can leave you with a 'perfect bald' look (sic). i have faced that in past.
as i found that there were 101 reviews on yelp alone giving this place a 4 star. it was must to visit this place.
the place is pretty easy to find as it's close to christie station. i walked past as i couldn't find the maya name board and later came back reading the number 635.
i was welcomed with an 'oasis apple juice' which is a good gesture. you will find customers wowed in all reviews post drinking the nectar. on cleanliness the place scores 4 out of 5. it was clean and the lady at the reception was herself busy cleaning when i arrived at 10 a.m. i found the maya team professional and warm. i will not call the ambience a 'wow' but when you pay 30$ for a women hair cut in to. it's o.k, if you don't choose a salon for its ambience.
my hairdresser (she didn't tell me her name) was looking a little confused to me. believe me i was very nervous as i went for a haircut after an year as i was getting over my perfect look i mentioned above. she showed me a book of korean girls with fancy hairstyle and asked me what i want. i could feel that she was new. luckily i did my research before coming and got the pics of hollywood celebrities with thin hair. 
she started and i went mum. she asked me before chopping every piece of hair and checked how i wanted. now this was something i really liked as she wasn't pushing her opinion down on me. as she progressed i gain confidence and i must say she did exactly what i wanted.
so i will give this place a 4.5 star not for value for money; but for getting what i wanted.",4

"the name of bobby's burger palace reminds me of that tv show bobby's world for some reason.  that has nothing to do with this restaurant or review, but whatever.

my friend & i were in vegas for the weekend.  we had plans sunday night, but of course we wanted to grab a bite to eat first. we didn't have a ton of time, and since we were staying near bobby's and yelp reviews were pretty good, we decided to try it out.

we walked in and the line wasn't too long. it was a little slow, but i was being indecisive on what i wanted anyway, so this gave me a little time to figure out what i wanted.  the burgers are on the gourmet (if you will) side (though you can get something more simple, i'm sure).  i opted for the bobby blue -- blue cheese, bacon, lettuce, & tomato -- crunchified (with potato chips on it).  i always order sweet potatoes when they're an option, so that was my side.  i wanted to try a spiked milkshake but didn't; maybe next time!

after ordering, you take your number and can pick your own seat (they do have carryout as well.).  the decor is clean and bright; i really enjoyed the look of the place.  we sat down, and our food came out as ordered in a timely fashion. after taking a quick picture of my burger for yelp, i dug in.... and it hit the spot!  the sweet potato fries were on point, and the burger was exactly what i wanted. it was how i ordered it (crunchified and well done).  the chips were a fun addition.

overall, we had a great experience and meal at bobby's burger palace. i would gladly go back here.  if you're looking for a fairly inexpensive (compared to other places nearby), good, and quick meal, this fits the bill.  it seemed like there might be a little room to grow and the line did take a little time, so i docked a star. still--i really enjoyed my meal here.",4

(always a plus in my book!)  the seats and venue were actually really comfortable.  the independent-type movie theaters around here are a smidge uncomfy and a lil rundown, so i was pleasently surprised with the bloor.  definitely a fan...glad we navigated the city to find it and can add it to our growing list of places we love in the to.",5

"i stumbled upon toyota of north charlotte while killing some time in between appointments at two other dealerships. before i was even out of my car tiara was outside with a friendly smile ready to help. she was so helpful during the test driving experience and so understanding of my indecisiveness. once we found a couple good options she got me set up with steve g.   these two were a dynamic duo, making sure that i was comfortable the entire time so attentive, caring, honest. honesty isn't normally a word people use when dealing with the car dealership but that was the only reason why i knew right then and there i was getting a car from this dealership. i canceled my other appointment and sat back as these two did all the hard work. a couple hours worth of back-and-forth dealing with banks, great conversation and lots of laughs we made a deal with best trade in value i received all week for my very old yet loyal car. next i know i'm in the great hands of jenelle harris. you would've thought she's been doing this job for years. her efficiency, knowledge and friendly personality made the most stressful part of buying a car a breeze.  she has regularly followed up and made sure no detail was left untouched. because of this great  i left behind the wheel of a great vehicle. thank you to everyone, i couldn't be happier!!!!",5
"our first visit. a nice place with a charming al fresco patio - a good place to take out-of-town visitors for a southwestern experience. since it's on the dreamy draw cycling route and very close to the arizona canal cycling path, a fine place to stop and lunch if one's on a ride in the area. the flour chips and salsa were delicious, the fish tacos and the pollo fundido were yum, and ice cold modelo amber is on tap! service was fast and attentive - my one complaint is that while a bottle of cold water hit the table immediately, water glasses never did appear.  i suspect that milady wife and i will become regular clients. food - three and a half stars, service four, and ambience a solid five.",4

"i've only had the macarons here.  i stopped by after breakfast (this place is sort of hard to find, it's underneath escalators) at bouchon to pick up some macarons for my sister before driving home.

i would have gotten more, but they had ran out of a lot of stuff!  they even only had one chocolate macaron left, so getting there earlier is a must.  regardless, the macarons seem pricey, but they're about as big as my palm, so it's well worth it.  they have pretty tasty macarons, but i wouldn't go as far as to say they're the best you can find -- maybe for vegas though.

i was considering giving this place four stars, but i couldn't really justify it.  but i still feel like five is a lot, so for accuracy, i'll say it's four-and-a-half stars.",5
"we were at this restaurant about 4'ish on monday afternoon during happy hour.  i ordered the kobe tacos as an appetizer and they were so spicy i could hardly eat them.  my girlfriend ordered the roast chicken w\/salsa and specifically asked for no halopenias.  the meal came out spicy hot.  upon complaining to the waiter, who was also the bartender, we were given the bill with no apologize or reduction in the amount.  although the restaurant is very quaint, customer service needs to be improved. we will not be going back to this facility.",1
"i stopped in this morning for a little something to jumpstart my love's birthday weekend. 

as i stood in line i tried to take in everything...the decor, food and drink menu items, and overall feel. if authentic french cafes are anything like this place, book me a ticket!

everyone was sitting doing their own thing just enjoying the moment. i attempted to read the menu items in my french voice in my head, but they came out sounding more like spanish...wished my son was there.

i ordered the provence blt for us to share, two palmiers because i hardly ever share sweets, and an iced coffee with vanilla (not sure of the french name).

i conveniently left the items in the car so that when we hopped in to begin his birthday weekend...""well whaddayaknow breakfast for our ride out to the vineyards!"" needless to say, the blt still tasted amazing. it hadn't become soggy or anything, he loved it! and those palmiers, the lady who took my order told me something about it being coated over and over in butter and sugar and i was sold. it was flakey and sweet and just plain yummy!

it was a perfect beginning to what was a perfect day and weekend!",4

"yes, that's right. you see five stars here. there is only 1 reason for the five star score, and that was our server brian (not bryan). came here on a thursday night after having some drinks at a couple of bars. on this particular night, the panthers were playing the eagles on thursday night football. i typically avoid places like this, but since my coworker was adventurous for lunch and had some craft beers with me (instead of bud light or mich ultra) i let him pick the dinner spot. he was talking about this place all day so i knew this is where we would end up. 

the place was absolutely packed with people. the food was good but nothing great. brian did a great job taking care of us. he was extremely busy but still never let our water glasses or beer glasses get empty. that is all i ask of a server. and to do that on a busy night is even harder, so he gets all 5 stars here. not much to add about the place itself, just a shout out to a great server. ask for him if you go.",5
"i like the new decor but the service was painfully slow especially since we were visiting with young children. 
when we got our bill i noticed we were overcharged on our pasta dishes which indicated $9.99 on the menu. when i questioned the waitress she said ""oh, did you want the lunch size"". well since we were there for lunch and we ordered from the lunch menu i would have thought that was obvious!!
for what you pay we could do much better elsewhere!! don't think we'll be back.",2
"i cannot exaggerate how amazing yardhouse is! their entree's are beyond delicious, their prices are reasonable, their atmosphere is big\/mellow\/fancy\/dimmed\/fun, their servers have always been friendly and it's quite welcoming! i love their food, it never seizes to amaze me how delicate their taste is! i've been here with groups of co-workers\/colleagues, on dates and not once have i've had a bad experience. yardhouse also has a bar with lots of beer\/wine\/alcohol selections so if anyone's curious, it's there.

anyways, my overall experiences with this restaurant have been phenomenal! highly suggested-",5

"came here on a lark, and glad we did. 

casual dining yet gourmet fare to a t. the chef and owner obviously take pride in their establishment, and it shows, from the friendly, very attentive staff to the exceptionally tasty yet simple cuisine. 

the place is fairly quiet (except for the bartender!), and seems to attract a younger, hip crowd. we can see why: very impressive date destination that won't break the budget! speaking of which, a small but excellent wine selection as well.

horrible!  it's las vegas in july in a family themed hotel and the pool closes at 7:00 pm. staff are unhappy and not the friendliest. room is old and in need of a remodel. no refrigerator or microwave. no bathtub. worst hotel ever!,1
"we have lived here for 7 years+, and maintenance is fantastic. you submit your requests online, and maintenance enters your apartment and fixes the problem, often within 24 hours. this includes both weekend days as well, and some trivial requests i made over the years. 

the office staff are also very knowledgable and eager to assist in any ways possible. and they give 400% when they are in the office!! sayra, patricia, and luz are in the office and they make it enjoyable to live here. the great thing about that team is you never know who is in charge, because all of them are working hard and helping out doing everything!! most equal place i have ever seen, and probably ever will.

we enjoyed moving in here. and we would tell our friends about this amazing apartment complex. who wouldn't want to live in a great place like this. trailside at hermosa pointe apartments are great for single and married people, and all families. it fits every ones needs. 

i read a review that someone didn't know what the area was all about and they moved in and where unhappy. well why would you give a bad star rating if you didn't do your research and make your own opinion. that is some one always blaming others for there mistakes. 

i am telling you, give trailside a try and see for yourself. the view is amazing and the staff is so happy to take care of you. luz is always accommodating with things and helps when she can. she also makes your day better when you see her because she is always smiling. patricia is there so you can talk to someone and feel right at home. patricia knows the property like the back of her hand. and what she does to go out of the way for the residents is amazing. just give them a try and see what i am saying. sayra the manager is great. she is always there to help out with your living needs. she always puts a smile on every ones face when you see her.

reviews are a dime a dozen and when you read some most people just hate that they are wrong and they are upset with being wrong. so what do they do???? start bashing who made them accountable for there actions. i know it's humane nature to feel that way but when you read a review and only go by a review then you are accountable for your actions for not trying it for yourself.",5

"mexican food.

i confess, i'm not a big fan of mexican food, except when i am actually in mexico.

we went for lunch.  they gave us chips and salsa to munch on.

i ordered the burro de la casa... what is that, the house burrito?

it just seems that no matter what i order in a mexican restaurant, it seems to all taste the same - rice, ripped up meat. beans, cheese, and some type of bread product to wrap it all together.

if you like americanized mexican food, you might like this place.",2

it was a great find.  while i don't usually find myself comfortable mingling with the scottsdale crowd... makes me feel old... the crowd here wasn't too ""typical"".  the staff here was uber friendly and fun.  the decor was eclectic and amusing. they pour a mean drink and the four peaks peach was the coldest i've ever had it poured. the menu was quirky and there were quite a few great choices on it.  the burger was delicious, the brownie was awesome.... definitely blow on it first... that peanut butter cup was a scorcher on my tongue. 

definitely a fun place to be and plenty of free covered parking next door is a plus!",5

"there wasn't a line when i went but quickly got busy from time to time. the menu is concise and small so it was easy to choose. i chose the cali bowl and it was really good. the fish pieces are good bite sized cubes and it tasted really good with hot rice on the bottom with the other garnishes and fresh ingredients. there's a lot going on in the bowl and it made me full really fast. it looks small, but it's very hearty. so many toppings! the only thing was that the fish wasn't the freshest but other then that it was good. i'd like to go try the pg bowl next time :)",4

"stopped for lunch today around 11:30 am. wife had a hard time finding a clean table. i was in line 15 minutes to place order. total confusion behind counter. we had the 3 piece tenders that came out cold. i asked for ranch dipping sauce and was told they are out of all sauces except for cilantro sauce which was disgusting. then i asked for ketchup for my fries and they were out of that. the salsa bar was filthy. the floors were dirty as were the windows. should have sent it back, but there were a couple ahead of us that were also not happy. i do not recommend. this is the dirtiest fast food place i have been in. not going back.",1

"i try to eat very healthy 90% of the times. i lead an active life style and am always looking for good healthy\/organic nutritional places to eat. i came across this place and became stoked because it was so close to my house. yesterday i decided to stop by with my boyfriend; first of all, holy expensive! i don't mind spending money on food specially if it's good quality but it wasn't. i ordered a greek pizza w out cheese on a vegan crust and it was so dry! the hummus looked old and i was burping it up two hours later. my boyfriend ordered a chicken wrap (which was not bad according to him) however he felt extremely bloated afterwards. lastly i had an acai bowl and i was so extremely disappointed, the granola was chewy and old tasting, the fruits were alright but the acai was off in color. it wasn't a rich purple it was more of a raspberry pink. seriously do not recommend. a myriad of people love it but i just want to share my experience.",1
"the fry was my first experience with korean fried chicken and i fell in love with it. it gave me the confidence to try korean fried chicken at other restaurants and it does not compare with the fry. they have a great combo with a few bottles of beer and a large portion of fried chicken. i recommend the green onion boneless chicken for the best experience. 

if you're daring and can handle your spice, go for the spicy chicken but be warned. it is hot, this is coming from someone who eats spicy on the regular and orders spicy for pad thais at thai express (if that gives you perspective?). 

i also highly recommend the spicy rice cake. it is delicious and the right amount of spicy. all in all i highly recommend this restaurant. expect about $15-20 per person for dinner.",4
"i will definitely be back! skydive las vegas was so great and helpful! they accommodated me and my sister in every way possible. i cannot say enough great things! 
we purchased the picture and video package, it was expensive but i highly recommend it. this is a great experience that gives you such a thrilling rush. my tandem instructor was mike, he was so cool and helpful with any questions or concerns i had.
i plan on coming back here when i return to vegas. i let mike know i was nervous and he helped explain everything so i had a great time and a better understanding. he even pointed out great views for us in the plane going up!
the plane was nice and clean. i have heard so many stories of how others who haven't gone here have been in rickety and loud planes where they did not feel safe. these guys at skydive las vegas have it going on! i never questioned my safety and i had a great feeling the entire time
i have already recommended this place to my friends and it has only been a week since i have gone. i will be seeing you soon and i cannot wait for my next jump! thank you again for making is so fun and pleasant! my sister and i had a wonderful time!",5
"this is a pretty trash mini golf course and i have been to my fair share.  we went on a saturday night in the middle of february...we are talking primo outdoor time in az...and they had one of their four courses closed.  then, adding to the already frustrating congestion, they over-sell to groups.  instead of sticking to their own posted rule of ""no more than 4 to a group"" they will allow families of 8, 10, 23 to group up and play together.  this, as you can imagine, causes some serious congestion on the links.
so after waiting 10 minutes for the group ahead of us to finish the first hole, we decided to skip over them and just come back and finish that hold later.  glad we did because we noticed a backup of 4 groups behind them as we neared the end.
the holes are decent but pretty unimaginative.  there really isn't much integration into the natural landscape which takes a bit of the fun out of it, plus there were multiple holes with the same ""trick"" on one course.  that makes for a pretty boring go 'round.  there are no pars listed for each hole which takes some of the fun out of the game.
this is a pretty low-rent golf course and they charge about $7 per player.  i guess that is a decent price but there are better places to play in the valley.",2

"i've heard so many good things about sing sing sign over the past 2 years that i just had to try them. first of all, i called them to get a quote and then called about 10 other print shops in town and nobody could come close to the price. finally i ended up saying to some quotes i was trying to get 'look, sing sing sign can get this done for x dollars per sign... can you match that?' and nobody could. 

1. best prices in town.

secondly, i'd like to say that they responded to my emails extremely quick! within minutes. they always answered the phone, they always knew what order i was talking about and they always got me the answers i needed fast.

2. amazing customer service

third, i ordered my signs at 1pm this afternoon and at 6pm they called me and told me it was ready for pick up. i ordered twenty signs and they're finished already! incredible.

3. incredibly fast service!

fourth, they are open early and late so it's easy to drop and pick up after normal working hours. this is a huge plus for someone like me.

4. good hours and easy access to shop.

i'm very impressed with sing sing sign and i will use them for all my printing needs in the future. very impressive.",5
"i was here this past tuesday night with a table of 9, and it was quite possibly the worst dining experience i've had. we had to ask another server to find our waitress to put in our food order, and she was all but impossible to locate when we were ready to pay the bill. she didn't have answers to the questions we asked about the menu, and she flat out said one of the wing sauces wasn't good when one of the people at my table asked what was in it. a server should never give a negative personal opinion about a menu item, especially when her opinion is unsolicited.

the wings i ordered (with a different sauce) were good and the beer was cold, but the service was awful and i will not be returning.",1
"amazing envrionment. the food was fine, the cocktails exceptional. service fantastic. started out in the restaurant and finished outside on the patio. the small menu is focused 100 beers available, creative cocktails executed perfectly. worth making a reservation if dining on a weekend.

while its not too hot, definitely opt for the patio dining experience.",3
don't let the name fool you! the best thing about this place is that you can make a reservation online! the food is way overpriced because of the chefs name. there is absolutely nothing new orleans about this place! i hade the bbq shrimp and jambalaya and shrimp. the jambalaya was watery and like none that i've ever had. one would think that a new orleans chef and restaurant with the name new orleans would prepare the cuisine new orleans style. we were highly disappointed and would not recommend this place to anyone that knows true louisiana food!,2
"came here for first time on new years eve with a small group of friends - despite the place being full we were seated quickly and our food arrived quickly and the waiter was very positive and humorous. 

the management is what makes coquine better than most comparable restaurants - i got a very positive vibe and no pretension from both the staff and patrons here, which is unusual for many upscale toronto restos.

the place instantly reminded me of a paris bistro, not a toronto bistro trying too hard to look like paris.    

i would return and i would also recommend this for business lunches.",4
"i did a good amount of research on window films before deciding which type of protection i wanted for my car.  for example, metallic films can interfere with your cell phone, so for me, those were off limits.  i wanted something that would give me the most heat reduction because, for some reason, my current car is like an oven and seems to retain heat more than other cars i've had or been in.  i also wanted very little loss of visibility - best of both worlds, yes, but that's what i hoped to get from the film.

after quite a bit of research, i decided i wanted either a ceramic film or crystalline, but geez, they're so expensive!  i phoned the few places in phoenix (and scottsdale) that actually use these type of films and the prices were simply unaffordable.  then, i called smartfilm.  not only did they beat everyone else's prices, but their phone demeanor was friendly and welcoming.  ok, so i had to drive out to the far reaches of mesa and drop my car for several hours.  ugh.  that made it really difficult to commit to using smartfilm.  solution?  the cool guys at smartfilm offered to give me a loaner car!  no kidding.  they let me take their little electric vehicle to the superstition springs mall so i could hang out for the 3-4 hours it would take to install the film on my car.  score!

now that it's about a month later, the films are performing beautifully.  we just had the hottest day of the year (122 degrees) and i was able to drive around in my car with the a\/c only up about a third of the way and i was completely comfortable.  it's a whole lot cooler in my car because of these films.  they're a total life saver.  i appreciated the help i got in selecting the films as well because smarfilm carries a line of high performing films and it was hard to choose between them.  i feel like i made the best choice based on the assistance that was provided.

for the best pricing on higher performance films and the best service period, come here.",5

"obsessed. las vegas has a handful of hot pot restaurants, and pot tea social is definitely on my top three. 

food: they have a total of 11 different pots, ranging from rib eye beef to lobster and even a veggie delight pot to cater to the vegans\/vegetarians. all their pots all filled with a delicious broth, various meats, various vegetables, and an option for steamed rice, minced pork or vermicelli on the side. if it's your first time, i highly recommend the rib eye beef pot with minced pork rice. that pot has a ton of stuff, like fish cake, tomatoes, cuttlefish ball, corn, quail egg, squid, etc. don't be scared, all the flavors do go well together and it's literally the perfect meal for the fall\/winter season. the meat to soup ratio is great, i was able to eat a spoonful of food with my soup, without having an uneven balance of soup or meat\/veggie at the end. the minced pork is very unique because it's not too heavy but still juicy enough to eat with the ingredients in your soup. they also have appetizers like sweet potato fries, chicken wings, popcorn chicken, and deep fried stinky tofu. all around, it is a great fusion of asian and american food. 

service: i've been here for both lunch and dinner, and both times they were slow. the service is average and i can't say they are too personable because it depends on your server that day. they are quick with getting the food out and checking on you at least one to either refill your water or to turn off the fire. i have nothing to complain because they were nice and the restaurant is very clean. 

overall: i took off a star because some of their broths could use more seasoning. i've only tried the rib eye beef pot, seafood & tofu pot, and japanese miso pot. my friends and family have tried the others and they can be rather bland. all the pots are $11.99 each with exception of the lobster pot that is $19.99. it's on the pricer side in my opinion because the vegetables used are cheap and there are not enough meat in the pot to justify for $11.99. i recommend to try this place if you're new to eating hot pot or just want a small meal (and spend $7 more at an ayce hot pot place for a real hot pot experience).",4
"i have been meaning to try taste of jamaica for a while, tried last week but they were close to closing and wouldn't make any shrimp.   since the power was out at home, i figured i would give it a try.  

located in a strip of stores at the intersection of mayfield and richmond roads, toj is a clean little shop with a bit of the island feel.  casual with reggae music playing it could be a cool place to hang.  you come in and order at the counter at the back, the menu is up on video screens.  i was a bit surprised when i asked about the jerk shrimp and was told that they don't make it.  i ended up ordering the curry shrimp with the rice and beans and a side of cabbage.  i also asked about a cup of water and was told that they don't have any cups.

after about a 15 minute wait, the food came up, you have to pick it up at the counter and it is packed in styrofoam to go, even if you are eating in.  for $13 i got 10 good sized shrimp, a large portion of rice and cabbage.  the food i got was good and well prepared, but while the flavors were nice, there was a lack of sizzle.  i love the food at bratenhal kitchen and found that toj just didn't have the same kind of flavors.  it was good, but not great. 

my opinion of taste of jamaica is that it is a nice place with decent food, but if i want jamaican food i have a better option which is a bit further, but i am willing to take the extra time for more flavor.",3
"i really want to gives this sprout's location 4 stars but over the past few months when i get a deli sandwich the bread has bean stale 1 out of 3 times i'm there so i can't do it. if this sprout's can consistently not give me stale bread i'd be happy.

on to the rest of the store....
sprout's is a great farmer's market with a great selection of produce as well as great meats, seafood and cheeses.",3
"very disappointed! both my boyfriend and i spoke with gary regarding dog trading for all 3 of our dogs, he consulted us over the phone and assured us he could help. we were definitely convinced and scheduled our first appointment, which was to follow in the next two weeks at our home. he ended up canceling an hour before our appointment and said we lived to far. nonetheless this is very unprofessional and should not be the way anyone conducts business!! don't bother wasting your time or money!",1
"sean is an incredible resource to have for help around the house and will treat you like family from the second he answers the phone. he helped me last minute with a situation that needed attention and i was amazed with his professionalism and respect for my issue.

i am relieved to have found this company and cannot recommend simple solutions enough for your home or condo needs. sean will be the first number i call any time the need arises. thanks again!",5
"didn't have a lot of different purses to look from. tons of wallets displayed. no one came to help me either. a gentleman that worked there stood on the men's side looking at me pace back and forth in the store but didn't bother to come over. it's ok man, i'll just help myself. one customer looked like she purchased half the stuff that was there so all the sale associates were hounding over her.",3
"i loved the customer service i got here! you can't beat it! i chose yao because of it's yelp and the fact that they were still open and willing to serve me a to go order at 8:45 pm. as i waited for my food, the women were both super friendly and genuinely interested in who i was. i felt like my 15 minute wait just flew by! the food was pretty dang good and definitely decently priced! i will for sure be going back to yao!",5
i'm having a wonderful evening with my friend karen at lucilles!!! we love this place. we enjoyed delicious fried chicken. they served us the best hot fried green tomatoes and garlic mashed potatoes and perfect cooked mixed vegetables. our server was savannah. she was attentive and polite and made our evening special  !!!! make sure you get the peach lemonade!!!! service was excellent.,5
"i really really want to love this starbucks but it hasn't happened. despite the beautiful decor, nice staff, and prime location, it still is just a 2 star place for me. last time i was here i waited at least 20 min for an iced americano. and today i'm sitting here, 8 minutes after ordering, waiting for my drink. it's not busy so i don't get it. you walk in and see no line and immediately think ""woohoo"" and then you look at the other end of the counter and see the 6 people still waiting for their orders to come out. i hope this place does improve!!",2
"so i haven't been here in forever and recommended it for our saturday night family dinner because it was amazing. unfortunately it was better then than now. we waited an hour from when our whole party arrived to actual food in front of us. and when it did arrive, some dishes were cold (from waiting on the counter while the others were being made) and they weren't as good as i remembered. the shenzhen chicken was super sweet, the hong kong noodles were bland as was the fried rice. the saving grace was the teppan-yaki beef. if all the dishes were as flavorful as the beef it would have been excellent. the waitress was sweet when she came around but ultimately drinks were not refilled without asking and i had to ask for chili sauce (to balance the sweetness) from the bar cuz she didn't check back with us. i probably won't be back, but will remember the restaurant as it was, and erase this dinner from my memory!",2
"second time eating here and i love it. it is my boyfriend and my 4 year anniversary. our server was training a young lady but even with that added stress to him, the service was still awesome. we sat outside to enjoy the night and watch the sun go down. 
we had another server assisting us throughout the night and she was amazing! wish i would have gotten her name. i even asked her for an amazing dessert choice and without me asking, she sent out a sampler free of charge. will be back again. 

ps: the bread and oil is amazing.",5
"i'm an avid fan of burgers and this was my first time at south st. burger. 

i ordered a 6oz mushroom and swiss cheese burger and it was great! the 6oz patty was moist and tender, and it was big enough to really fill me up. my favourite part was that they had a wide selection of complementary toppings to choose from, including guacamole! if you've read my previous reviews, you'll know that i absolutely love guac and considering certain franchises charge up to $2 more for it, it's such a steal that this place offers it for free. just beware that this burger gets a little messy - the sauteed mushrooms are quite watery and the burger wrapper will definitely not hold! 

i'm not a big fan of hot dogs but i ended up trying a bite of one anyway and it was fairly good - the sausage was juicy and smoky. it was a bit smaller than i imagined lengthwise but it definitely makes up for it in width!",4
"great place to start the night. got vip passes for $20 a piece included a drink. vip just puts you closer to the stage. place is kinda small but fills up. the comedians were hilarious. we went on a tues night at 8:30. 2
comedians and 3 dancers.",5
"my first poke bowl in town and i loved it. fresh, tasty and fully loaded flavours! we got the signature cali bowl, small size and it was filling. there's a hype around sushi burritos but i rather head over to poke guys any given day. you get more fish, more veggies, nori, and just more. poke bowls isn't just another chirashi bowl. they marinate their fish and you get to choose 5+ different sauces if you want another depth of flavour. i recommend the wasabi mayo. has a lovely kick. i will be back next month!",4
i only come here for their happy hour. they have a great happy hr. they have a ra sushi in vegas as well... i hit that happy hour up too. lol! they are one of the rare places that has happy hr on the weekend. service and food is overall good.,4
the service was not great and there was gross stuff floating in the tap water they gave us it the food was good.,2
"don't take your animal to this facility.  the emergency vet, jp, was incredibly insensitive. she intentionally tried to frighten me by telling me i should be worried because my dog's urine was red alluding to blood being in her urine.  later i found out that my dog's urine was discolored from the medications the veterinarian began administering the day before.  she either intentionally tried to intensify my worry or is stupid..  care put my dog on medications that weren't appropriate for dogs with her condition.  care admitted that my dog needed an internist, but they did not have one available that week, yet disagreed with me when i asked that they discharge her so i could take her to an internist. thank goodness i took my dog away from this place as they had her on the wrong medications for her condition. care clearly needs to pay for the big beautiful well-staffed facility so they said my dog needed emergency care target than being home with her family. my dog is much better now.  we won't ever take another one of our animals to care.",1
"it is hard not to be really angry when a dry cleaning company ruins something you paid $250 for, in this case a 100% cotton quilted comforter. the care instruction tag was still on the comforter, and the owner claimed she read the tag and cold water washed in a light woolite wash. the once white background is now pale green. a couple of the seams were ripped open. the cotton batting inside is now big lumps. there were a couple stains where my cat had vomited, and where the woman cleaned those stains, the background is still white, so why is the rest of the background green? no one called me before the comforter was washed to warn me this could happen and give me the option not to have it cleaned. no one called me after they ruined it to tell me. when i picked it up, no one admitted they ruined it. i noticed right away, and the counter girl went and got the owner. she gave excuse after excuse, but i just don't believe her. i had to force her to write down how she cleaned the comforter so i can pursue this with the manufacturer. there was no offer made to compensate me for the ruined comforter.",1
"great pool fence! stylish and secure. installed with the utmost care are professionalism. quick response from the time we called for a quote, decided in the fence and install. great company to work with!",5
"friendly service, good prices, quality food.  my wife and i both got the ono fish.  mine was blackended, hers with the asian seasoning.  we haven't had ono fish since we were in hawaii years ago.  we'll be back for sure.",4
"this was my first time here and i had the walleye fish & chips. the batter dipped breading was a little thick, but very good. i had a scotch ale with it, which was very good, smooth and fairly light. great service.",4
"i like this casual fine dining. their menu is pretty simple too. just choose an appetizer, a main and a dessert. and they have a great beer selection too.

my favorite was actually the dessert. the rice pudding was awesome. i would come back and just hang out in the bar just for the rice pudding. but the veal and sweetbreads was also noteworthy.

ambiance was great too. again, casual, but seemed pretty intimate too. and fine dining without the pretentious service.",4
"stopped by for a tour here with my doctor friend whose father is a patient here.   back when i was starting to look for jobs i heard about this place recruiting so it was interesting to see what it has developed into.   i would absolutely love to work in a place like this with lots of windows, sunny atmosphere, interesting design space, and a crazy facade by gehry.   one of the research folk (pre med) was nice enough to take us on a tour (their last one of 2012) and it was nice to see how the research and clinic spaces interact.  a plus for the patients is beautiful facilities with a lot of art, much of it neurologically themed.  there is a beautiful warped melting-wall gehry style meeting room for special events.  an oasis for neurological care, head by quite well known and famous neurologists.   i wish we had a building and a medical team like this near me!",5
"sehr schönes gehobenes restaurant und weinstube in cannstatt.


 die atmosphere ist sehr edel und es wird wert auf stylische kleinigkeiten gelegt (z.b. handgearbeitete tassen als pendelleuchten über dem tisch).


 sehr gelungen.


 die speisekarte ist übersichtlich und die auswahl aussergewöhnlich.


 das salatdressing im salat ist der hammer!!! unbedingt probieren.


 die portionen sind ausreichend und der service ist sehr zuvorkommend, manchmal sogar etwas zu viel.


 die weinkarte ist sehr groß. es werden vor allem regionale und österreichische weine angeboten.


 sehr empfehlenswert!!! hingehen!!!",5
check in here is horrendous... spent less time in economy tsa at lga... 1.5 hours... they have mobile check in but i never received my confirm and had to wait anyway,1
"i dined here recently with my girlfriend for az restaurant week. we had a specially memorable evening, as everything was perfect, or just near. the wines we chose in the wine flights were particularly palatable, as was the food (though they lost points when the server had no idea about a couple of wines we asked about). the appetizers were nice little meals on their own - she had the lobster in lettuce cups, i the ahi tuna tartar stack, which was nice, sans the tortilla chips instead of...toast points, maybe? i had the cioppino for entree, which, for a seafood lover like me, was just sheer bliss. my date had the tilapia, which we both thought was a tad on the ""swampy"" side, though it was still edible enough. we finished with key lime pie for her, and the chocolate s'more souffle pour moi, which we both gobbled with the abandon only dedicated gourmands can know. all in all, a wonderful evening. our dinner came to close to $90, but i felt it was worth it. 

one of the nits we had was the decor, once the lights started to come up at the end of the night. steamers, you need new chairs and tables. we thought they looked like they belonged at golden corral, not in an otherwise opulently decorated space with old world ambience. luckily, we reserved a booth.",4
"great exhibition. i'm extremely fascinated by the human body, as i'm sure most people are. the presentation is fantastic. the bodies and organs are displayed in very creative and artistic ways and this lends itself to a more palatable way of staring at what are really just preserved dead bodies. 

the science and art are combined in such an interesting way. there are also some great staff around to answer all your questions and clarify anything you might be wondering about. 

i'd recommend this exhibit to anyone. i know it's showing in many cities, so if you happen to have one near you take the opportunity to see it at least once. you won't be disappointed.",4
"enjoyed a wonderful lunch meeting here last week with a great view of the famous aquarium. while we were eating the aquarium was being cleaned by professional divers and the experience was surreal. i had the watermelon\/feta salad and the blackened flounder with asparagus, and walked out in that sweet zone between hungry and stuffed, also known as 'just right'. service was excellent as well.",4
"i remember eating this pizza everyday at barry goldwater in high school as they had it for lunch at the cafeteria.  the pizza is really good and is definitely worth checking out, as it's not too pricey.",5
"i went to this place while i was in town attending a tradeshow. i arrived at 8:30 pm on a thursday night and the place was packed. they only had seats open along the walls which is almost like bar seating but most people stand because it's just that type of place if you are eating inside. the decor and vibe were amazing with lots of people coming and going trough the evening. i was there with 2 of my friends and we ordered pretty much one of everything on the menu. one of my favorite plates was the octopus. the drinks were very well made and i also enjoyed this passion fruit beer that was brewed locally in toronto. i would rate this place 5 stars if you could reserve a table. the only thing i would complain about was the fact that even after i was already inside the restaurant consuming food and drinks i was not able to be put on a waiting list for a table. the staff pretty much told me that it is first come first serve. so as soon as i saw a table that opened up i immediately ran to it and established myself before anyone else tried to grab it. the staff did help me and my friends move all of our food and drinks over from the wall\/bar area to our table. overall the food was great and the drinks amazing. the service was also exceptional. i really recommend this place for anyone that is looking for a fun time with amazing decor, food and drinks.",4
"grabbed some take out on the way home (on a weeknight at 7pm) and was absolutely shocked how good it is for take out sushi! how can it be fresh at this time of day?! 

$14.95 for a combo that comes with free miss soup: 6 piece jumbo roll of shrimp avocado crab tobiko, another 6 pieces of avocado roll and 4 pieces of nigiri. 

everything was fresh and delicious. the jumbo roll was really flavourful. shocked that the avocado was so ripe and good quality that what i thought was a crappy filler roll was actually delicious. all the raw fish on the sashimi was good too. 

to top things off service was very friendly and chirpy from the cashier! i can't believe they have such poor reviews. what a great experience.",5
"super great service! their iced lattes are to die for! great prices compared to other chains like starbucks or locally owned beans n cream. the only complaint is that it can be hard to order through the drive thru (especially when wanting a large order of donuts) i would recommend just going inside for your order unless your getting a simple quick drink- things tend to get easily messed up and your order can come out wrong.
also- i just have to mention the dunkin' donuts app as well! super easy to recharge your card and can earn points quickly to get a free drink! i love it",4
got an express mani-pedi through groupon and had a fairly good experience! the girls were very nice but my nails did chip within a few days. which is not too awful considering it was only $20 with the groupon deal. the place itself is really quite nice and everyone was very friendly.,4
"i have ordered from many capriotti's. unfortunately, this is this closest location to my house.  do not order from this location if you love the capriotti's flavor.  this location doesn't deserve the sign on the front of their building.  customer service is key, and this is where they have failed.",1
"corktown designs jewellery gallery is more than a jewellery store.. they do carries handbags and other accessories.

there are a great selections of necklaces, charms, rings and earrings all displayed nicely in the cabinets... the problem is if you go on a busy day like i did, you will not able to get any assistance at all from anyone!

prices are on the expensive side as expected since it is in the distillery district.. but there are some smaller accessories that you can get as little gifts or stocking stuffers for your loved one!

there are some strange pieces like a whole set of jewellery  that makes of zipper's pull tabs! i don't think i want that! :p and i don't care how much they cost!",3
"i've been to this mall a lot, and it pretty big and it has quite a few different type of stores, middle class type of stores and high ones. the food court has a few different type of restaurants. it has a fashion runway, which obviously hold fashion shows (hence the name). the only thing i don't like is that sometimes it can be a bit hard to get to it (the mall), because of it's location. also, i really think it shouldn't close at 9pm, since it's in the strip. when the mall is about to close, it turns on it's alarms. the first time i went there, i literally thought the mall was on fire.  overall, it's a nice mall to go to.",4
"just left this place after ordering sushi and waiting 1hr20min and left hungry. food never came with slow hand jack at the sushi bar...tho orders put in after ours were filled. we were given a table meant for 2 and squeezed our threesome in. and to top it off, we were still charged full price for our drinks and soup. lame! hana's on 7th ave is the place to be! take heed!!!",1

"best dog walking service in the city!  i've been using barks n purrs for the past year and it's always very easy to schedule walks and make changes if necessary.  all the walkers are true dog lovers and really treat your dog as if they were their own.  my walkers have also gone above and beyond and cleaned up any ""accidents"" that may have happened before they arrived. i always get a little note about how the day went and i sometimes get picture updates of their adventures.  i'm relieved to know that my dog is out having a blast with her friends while i'm at work, i wouldn't trust her with anyone else!",5
"got the camaro burger (double). the patties tasted like they did not have any seasoning or salt, they were greasy. the grilled onions were hard, not cooked long enough. the bun fell apart and i would up with a mess all over my hands as i ate the burger.
the best part was the wrapper on the burger which had an outside foil which kept my burger hot when i got home which was a first. great idea. 

i'm going back to carl's to get their ""big carl"" burger which is much better and has a lower price.",1
"stayed here for 2 nights from july 9, 2010

aria is one of the hotels situated at the ""city center,"" aspiring to be at the epicenter of vegas.  its embrace of modernity is evident from the moment you pull within view.

upon entering the futuristic, metallic lobby, you'll notice a pleasant perfumed air.  i couldn't put my finger on what it was, or where it came from, but it definitely beat the smell of cigarettes and old people.

a security guard is posted in front of the elevators, requiring you to flash your room key for admittance.

the hallways are labyrinth-like, and split into separate pathways one too many times.  they keys are magnetic, so you just wave your room key in front of the doorknob.

the room we got (pretty standard one) was very clean, and sleek.  the sheets were amazingly soft too.  the bathroom had a 2-person shower and tub, which is standard for the newer hotels -- nothing outstanding.

unfortunately, i didn't get a chance to check out the pool, or dine at any of the restaurants. 

as it is currently one of the newest hotels, it is a bustling and loud place.  there is also a casino downstairs, but i would recommend staying away from the blackjack tables around check-in times because you'll probably be surrounded by players just killing time while waiting for their friends (which means they'll take the dealer's bust card, and have you walking with a stink face).

finally, the service, from what i saw, was amazing.  when i was walking down the hotel hallways, i was greeted by at least 2 employees with a smile and ""hello.""  i'm not sure who recruited their employees, but they were successful in trying to make a good new-opening impression.",4
"we walked in tonight to a mostly empty bar. i've been to the location in tempe marketplace and always liked it so i thought this one would be the same. there was no one at the front so we sat ourselves at a high top near the bar. while we waited to be served, two other groups walked in and sat. all of us including the other two parties ended up walking out with being served or acknowledged.",1
"i place an order askind for jalapeñes only on half of my pizza, when they delivery it was full of jalapeños.   my husband call and ask to talk to a manager she said that she made the pizza her self and that apperantly they can not put only an ingredient on half of a pizza. we know for a fact that it can be done because we always place orders with half jalapeños for the kids.  she answer in a very rude way.  then we call back and placed an other order by phone and 20 min later they call to make sure the order was legit.",1

"let's face it, we live in a society where you can find a burger just about anywhere. however, i challenge you to find a better burger anywhere else, because i've tried and cannot do it! 

they have the best burgers, plain and simple. the double-double is burger perfection. toasted bun, slim and juicy burger patty, fresh lettuce, special sauce and add on some banana peppers like i do, and you have burger heaven. my dad and i used to stop at this place no less than 3 times on our california trips, so once they built them out here in az, it was a dream come true. 

they are always fast, friendly, and fresh when you come to eat here, and the taste is outstanding. in fact, i think i'll go pick one up later, because writing about it makes me really want one...",5
"okay.  so i was there on july 1st for breakfast. we ordered several items so don't judge me. we were given monkey bread to start.  i didn't love the bread but the sauce was amazing.  so lets continue. 1. the lobster bisque has nice large pieces of lobster swimming in a pink sea of cream topped with shaved scallions.  it was soooo good. 2. the pear salad.  this dish is leaving the menu to make room for seasonal tomato salad so get this while you can.  the combination of toasted salted walnuts, bleu cheese, radicchio, golden raisins and of course the poached pears were indescribable.  devine. 3. lemon mascarpone pancakes with blueberry compote. come on.  so light and fluffy and fabulous. 4. shrimp and grits with beer blanc sauce.  i swear i think my heart stopped when these arrived to greet my taste buds.  the grits were so creamy and cheesy with a little bite left to them topped with that amazing sauce with small grape tomatoes scattered about.  three large shrimp perfectly cooked.  this was my favorite thing i ate all weekend in cleveland.  so after all this we kept talking about it the rest of the day.  went to see u2.  woke up and decided we couldn't leave without a revisit. 1. eggs benedict oscar with asparagus.  this was wonderful, but its hard to beat the shrimp and grits so i can't even put it close to the running of best.  2. the bananas foster french toast.  i can say this without a doubt was the most gorgeous and spectacular sweetness on a plate.  i wanted to tell every table to order it. the caramel sauce was so fabulous. 3. the potatoes with malt vinegar aoli.  why did i not think of this recipe myself.  i could go on and on, but you will have to wait until i return to hear me roar once again.",5

"yes it's loud, because people are enjoying them selves, you know like having fun while enjoying a delicious meal after a stressful day at work..  yep, if one have a peanut allergy they shouldn't patronize it... du!!  

the texas roadhouse not only don't take reservations on new years eve, they don't take them the other 364\/365 days per year either.. only call ahead.  i have a problem with any one that would sit around for 55 minutes, checking out how dirty  a establishment is, than turning around and eating there,   now i have a problem with that... and that over priced wine,  wait a minute.. it took 2 glasses before one decides they cold get a bottle at the store cheaper.....   

texas roadhouse,  have some of the most  friendliest  greeters and servers as any restaurant in champaign-urbana.. i've eaten there since the first week they opened their door, and their staff has always been very  courteous and efficient (here just a couple days ago)... i also call in pick up orders, and i received the same great and efficient service as i do when i dine in...

"we were expecting amazing thai food after all the reviews that we read and the fact that this place was voted one of the top 100 restaurants in toronto. 

this was disappointing. 

first off, it was really awkward sitting on the benches outside on the sidewalk, as people walked past us while to wait for our table. 

second, when we were seated, it was so loud. it felt like we were in a high school cafeteria. there was so much noise from people talking over each other and from the loud music. we were just happy that we didn't have to share a table with another couple. 

finally - food was mediocre. i was extremely disappointed with the curry egg noodle dish. it was awkward to eat and i felt sick about half way through because the curry was too rich. on the flip side - i had a taste of my company's dish and it wasn't that great either - he had the beef stir fry dish with rice. the meat was nice and tender, but it wasn't flavourful. 

wasn't worth the hype, unfortunately.",2
"best korean bbq at las vegas. 
it's nice and clean and good service. 
i would come back again.",5
this was a great steakhouse for the first time and the service was great if you want to splurge this is the place to go my ribeye was great and cooked perfectly. would definitely recommend this place to everyone so if you love steaks etc this is the place to go.,5
"love this location, the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and i am always very pleasantly surprised at my total when i'm being rung up.

the only negative is that they cut it really really close with their expiration dates.  i can see the value in not throwing away food, but no one wants something that expires that day or the next day, especially when i'm shopping for the week.  i've even found things that have already expired on the shelves. i try to shop on mondays or tuesdays because that's when they seem to refresh their stocks but they could really work on not having expired\/close to expired food on the shelves.

overall though, great store!",4
"stopped in with my sister after a sunday afternoon movie... perfectly located right across the street from the theater.

the outside of the building made it look like this was a really nice place to go to enjoy a meal... and what happened on the inside did not disappoint.   

we were greeted in a very pleasant manner by the hostess.   she welcomed us with a big smile and asked us if we preferred a booth or table, which i personally love having the option.    she answered my sister's questions about the delicious looking pineapple filled decanter on the bar, which apparently is their pineapple martini, which i would have loved to try... maybe next time... 

my sister and i sat in the dining room and the décor was lovely.   it was like being in an upscale hunting lodge.  the only thing i didn't like was the big dead head above the fireplace.  i get it - hunters hunt and i eat meat, and it's all about population control- ok, ok, but that's for a different website, i still don't like to see heads unless they are perched upon a majestic animal.   i'm entitled to my opinion. 

she and i shared the ahi tuna appetizer, which was very nicely done and presented.  it was served with a nice side of greens, which was delicious.  especially loved the hot mustard sauce it was served with.

i enjoyed the colorado chicken salad which had amazing greens, tender juicy chicken, bleu cheese, apples, cranberries, and walnuts.  it was super super good and the dressing was perfect. 

my sister had the crab cake salad and she loved hers, too.   she had been to firebirds a time or two before this and really loved the experiences she had had before.  

i'm really glad we stopped in and in the land of restaurants in the arrowhead area, i really hope this one stays for a long time, i'd really love to try their other dishes!!",5
"so i really wanted to love la belle et la boeuf. in the end, i think it's a really chill place if you're down for a drink - but as a restaurant, i don't think it's anything special.

let me start by saying their drink list is extensive. they have wine, spirits, absinth, beer, really anything you could think of - plus their share of unique cocktails, all of which sound amazing. i tried a cocktail called the pacman, which looked delicious and tasted even better, and i'm definitely going to go back to try many more (all?) of their drinks. 

the vibe is great, too. the rustic decor plus the crowd kind of makes it feel like a really trendy bar instead of a restaurant, which i think is great. the music might have been on the loud side, but it wasn't anything unmanageable. our server was super nice, too. no complaints there.

really, the only thing that didn't leave a lasting impression on me was the food. i had the beauty burger with fries, and the meal comes with coleslaw and a kool-aid pickle. my favourite parts of the meal were the coleslaw and the pickle; the burger didn't stand out as much as it should have, and the fries weren't the best. 

all in all, i've had better hamburgers and fries. as a burger joint, i wouldn't say it stands out. as a trendy place to grab a drink, though, i'd totally recommend it.",3
"the pad thai is horrible. way to dry... way too many bean sprouts with some crushed peanut on top. i would not recommend if that is the dish you desire. maybe other items are okay, but i strongly recommend avoiding the pad thai.",1
"the service was awful. we came in with 7 people and it took us almost 2 hours to order, get our food and eat. the worst part was that if they were busy i would want understand but they weren't. i am giving 3 stars as most liked the food but the fries were cold and stale. i will not return anytime soon if at all",3
i was very impressed with the professionalism and courteousness of the staff upon my check in. the room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. the free breakfast in the morning was pretty good too.. i am somewhat of a coffee snob and their coffee was pretty good.  i would definitely stay here again...,5
"i had a bbq pork and duck rice dish, for 7$. the portion is very generous, and the food tastes authentic, it reminds me of hong-kong.
all dishes under 10$, very quick services. definitely recommending to all of you.",5
"my co-workers and i come here for lunch several times a week. the wait staff has come to know us and do all they can to help us speed through the lunch break, since we get only 45 minutes! 

the food is terrific, especially the french fries! and we all love the homemade ranch dressing. 

they have a lunchtime loyalty program, and if you go on your birthday, you get to spin the wheel for a variety of prizes! lots of fun and great food . . .what more could you ask for?",5
"$2.50 jagershots + good food = happy chris.

happy or happy drunk? either or this is a sweet spot if you live in the east end.  i tried the flatbread which was really good.  this place is usually bumping on the weekend...well $2.50 jagers, after 5 of those you should be good to go.",4
"having more dealings with this company, i give  all fair warning that you run the risk of being robbed and lied to.  once reading this warning if you continue to use this location you have been warned and deserve what you get.  i can't believe cadillac can even associate with this dealership.",1
"i love their hong kong style milk tea and bun combo for $1.80. other bakery items such as sponge cakes, egg tarts, and pineapple tarts are delicious. check it out, you will not be disappointed!",5
very nice restaurant. ordered takeout and sat at the bar while we waited. friendly professional bartenders. i'm not a fan of calamari. as a matter fact i really dislike it however companion ordered it and of course i thought i'd try some again. it was delicious perfectly made.  the food came out promptly and it was very good except my rice and beans or very very spicy but good. the portions were also very good. i would most definitely go back to this restaurant the food was excellent the staff was friendly and professional and the wait was not long at all. i want to add that they don't have jambolaya on the menu. really strange for seafood place that spouts cajun in louisiana style seafood. very big disappointment,4
"this location is always clean, friendly, and fast! everything i would want a restaurant to be! i went in 10 min till closing and those 2 girls were so sweet letting me take my time, recommending sandwiches. they even turned the grill back on for me so i could toast my sub. my #5 was so delicious i'll be back again tomorrow night",5
"we love this place. great atmosphere. terrific food. make sure to go for half off appetizers during happy hour. the only downside is the really long wait, but we lucked out and got in after 10 minutes or so last saturday.",5
"i frequent this place often to satisfy my ramen craving. with 2 locations in downtown toronto, sansotei is super convenient to access as well. this time i ordered to tonkotsu with thin noodles and zangi (fried chicken) to share.  the zangi is different from the typical karagee, the skin is slightly thinner and more crispy rather than crunchy. 

their tonkotsu broth is always super rich, although it does not leave me as heavy as some other ramen shops. you also get one soft boiled egg with your ramen, which is really a party in your mouth. i love placing one half of the egg in my ladle and filling it with broth, and then one-shotting it (you will thank me). 

if you haven't been to this toronto classic yet, i implore to do so!",4
"this was ny first visit ever to get a mani pedi,  i really enjoyed my visit, i was treated very well and the service was top notch, i'm glad i came here for my first time,  enjoyed the mimosa, while being pampered,  everything was great,  i will definitely return and suggest to my friends",5
"best spa in vegas !! cannot give enough praise to all the staff. we live in vegas and sneak away every 4 weeks for our spa day, we stay 2 days at the south point with tuesday being all about us , 80 min. massages in the morning and 80 min. facials in the afternoon. highly recommend !! i've checked price range as moderate because we are locals so we get a discount. but also because years ago we visited other local spas and the pricing is comparable.",5
"drunk food at its finest! you can't go wrong with breakfast food and drunken folks. it's easier to go here and get grub than drunkenly go home and try and cook. the service is solid, quick, and the food is affordable.  however, i've never been sober, because i'm afraid that my view of the joint well go south.",3
"super good ffod, friendly, order is always read wehen we get there, no issues. very happy!",5
"amazing!!! fresh, locally sourced, great people, fun atmosphere...what's not to like?",5
oops it looked so good that i forgot to take a picture. today i had a new offering - the aphrodisiac oyster hash. very good but the eggs benedict with crab meat is still my #1 favorite. this place is so good for breakfast that i will have to make a point of trying lunch here.  oh fyi they brew a great pot of coffee too,5
manic stands out from the other great coffee shops i've tried in that the espresso tastes different from a majority of them and yet i would rate them just as high. they are uniquely good. i had a very pleasant experience with the baristas who were very accommodating and welcoming. this place is easily in the top 5 best coffee\/espresso shops in toronto. a personal list of mine which i will be creating in yelp soon.,4
"best haircut i've ever had in my life! chelsey was amazing she made my hair perfect, and was very nice and knowledgeable. she really knew what she was doing. everyone at focal point was very friendly and the atmosphere was very nice and upscale. while i have never done any of the spa side like injectables the staff is friendly and they pictures of the work they have done seem top notch, i will definitely keep coming back here.",5
"service was sub par. food tasted okay. i sent back a bowl of not so fresh fruit, waitress tried to tell me why i was misinformed, i guess my 15 years of food service experience counts for nothing. honey dew melon should not be clear and grapes should not be shriveled, that my friends is not fresh. will never walk into this establishment again.",1
"very poor experience at hertz las vegas airport!!  might as well use a bargain rental agency.  hertz is supposed to be ""the name"" in car rental, but they failed me.
went to get my car, only to find that it was dirty.  very dirty.  i could see where the car had been taken through the automated car wash, but i could also see every area of the car that isn't reached by that automated car wash, and apparently isn't reached by any of their lazy employees either!  when i went to complain, it took a while to find someone who wanted to claim that they were in charge of this circus.  when i finally did, the supervisor would provide me with a clean car, but rather took us though the automated car wash again.  i have to admit, that's a part of las vegas that i hadn't seen before, but the car was still dirty in most of the places that it was before we rode through the car wash.
very poor product.  very poor service from supervisory staff.  done with hertz.  i paid more to rent here to avoid the bs that's abundant at the discount car rental joints.  apparently, it's not worth it.",1
"just had my 2006 saturn ion repainted with hi star and they did an excellent job.  it looks terrific.  price was great, service was great.  good experience all the way around and i would recommend then for a paint job without hesitation.",5
"this place always has great deals on excellent quality items and is coupled with wonderful service! just bought 2 pairs of barely-used sneakers for my husband and the gentleman helping us, o'leary, realized that one of the pairs should have been marked down more, so took off an extra $15 at the register without us even asking anything. we always find impeccable deals at well suited and will continue to frequent it!",5
my order got messed up but appreciated the friendly attitude to fix it and leave me a satisfied customer,4
"show up and housekeeping hasn't even cleaned the room. and whoever designed this place needs to be fired. there is no easy\/quick way to get to where you need; (take one elevator to one floor, walk across the entire place to get to another elevator to bring you to your floor). the elevators are always super busy yet there is no stair access from the 2nd floor up. nobody will answer questions or provide any helpful info. oh and then there are the hundreds of screaming little children.",1
$13 for a sangria that is subpar and you can't even taste the alcohol in? ridiculous.. i will not return here. side note the cheese curds were great,2
"small store front and eclectic decor. food is on the pricier side but once you see the portion you won't be disappointed. i got the duck pizza which was huge but a little on the salty side. from what my friends ordered, pasta and stuffed chicken seemed like good options to go for. overall not amazing but definitely a pleasant experience",4
"went to sincerely yours for a mani\/pedi with my wonderful nail tech marina who now works there. she did her normal fantastic job!  i asked if someone could cut my dull lifeless gray rooted hair afterwards, and i'm so glad i did!!  danielle cut and colored my hair and i look and feel much better!! danielle is a sweety for fitting me in like she did.  i found the whole vibe of the salon to be upbeat and friendly. will definitely go back for both nail and hair services.",5
a good place to go when you just want to chill and grab a drink.   didn't eat anything.  bartender was super nice.  prices were good.  great after work or after a game spot.,4
"this is a great place for breakfast lunch and dinner. killer drinks and a great view too, they have a fabulous sunday brunch that is second to none. the tortillas are all homemade. cocktails are to die for",5
"phenomenon bar! ambiance and the owner paulius was very welcoming, friendly and just simply wonderful.  drink is worth every single dollar! just quality drinks serve. i will definitely be back when i'm in cleveland.  a must relaxation stop with some jazzy-classy music. looooove it!",5
best white chocolate mocha i've tasted in a while...wish the morning energy was a bit more upbeat. love to go back and try one of their pastries and maybe a lunch item. i'm hoping the register guy was just having a slow start to his morning. i'll be back for another go!,3
"if you're wandering around easter road and are in need of a quick bite to eat, then the filling place is as good as any other. 

the filling place certainly can ruffle up a good sandwich, especially a ham and cheese salad baguette! and what made it even better was that the cheese was extra special, as it is sourced from the famous cheesemongers of edinburgh, iain mellis. 

this little cafe however, doesn't just do sandwiches. they do baked potatoes, soups, paninis and salads. all the produce looked fresh and the shop smelt full of fantastic flavours. i also believe you can purchase cheeses and hams from the cafe's deli counter. and the prices aren't too bad either, actually on the cheaper side of the coin. 

when i was in the cafe it wasn't that busy, and that in a way was quite nice, munching a small lunch time snack while people watching from the window seats. that will do me nicely.",4
"i want to add to the wonderfulness of my experience with getting a new roof: i also needed ceiling repair inside, so i chose carl, who works with mike from stell, for the work. he and his team sealed everything off, took down the popcorn ceiling, repaired and replaced as necessary, painted and cleaned up - all in a professional, amicable, above-and-beyond atmosphere. he will do a great job for you as well!
***final update***
there was an issue with nails coming through in the outside entryway. i called junior and he apologized profusely, arranging to have the problem corrected right away. it was fixed so well that you can't tell there was a problem in the first place. this is how a business ought to be run. thanks again, stell roofing.",5
"i arrived at 10;00 pm and tried to use the self check in kiosk which told me that my room wasn't ready yet.....  really at 10;15 at night,  i got in the check in line and after standing in line for more than two hours i finally got to the counter and i politely complained and the tropicana representative who never offered an explanation as to the 2+ hour wait nor did she say sorry that i had to wait so long.  she had zero compashion\/sensitivity for my situation!!!!!!!   when i booked the room online i booked a room with a view of the high roller and  when i open the curtains to my room i was very surprised that i had no view that i paid for!!!!!!!   so what was i to do........ go back down stairs and wait another two hours in line to complain again.............. by now it's past midnight and thsts not going to happen.  ""i feel sory for the ladys in front of me who were just staying one night""  the valet and bus boys were awesome,  but the check in was a disaster they obviously had no sense of urgency or customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!!   the next day i met up with friends who were also staying there and they mentioned coupons they got at check in which i never got  ""shocker""!!!!!!!!!!!!   what a disaster weekend,  if the undercover ""boss"" would have been there he or she would have fired the management on the spot because they were diplorible  and not even visible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   i hope the management at the flamingo gets it right because the front desk is a disaster. i will never book at the flamingo again and will tell my friends\/family to book somewhere else because of the front desk nightmare!!!!!!!!!!! so -----  do not book at the flamingo becauseyou get one stay treatment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    i tell it like it is!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"i've tried all their $2 tacos from the meathead, brains to the spicy pork and tripe. i have no complains about this joint. affordable and your taste buds screams for more!! you will leave with a satisfied hunger and a happy wallet!! i will definitely be back! (i've been here twice in the past 24 hours already) and you got to love their hours of operation. can't get any better than this when you had a few drinks with the company of wonderful people\/family & an appetite for really good food after drinking for a few hours :) totally worth the drive regardless which part of town you live at even for visitors!!

i always get everything on it especially the pineapple slice with the spicy pork taco!",5
"we used to visit ichabods at least once a week when you could get the best salad bar in town  for free with an entree.. then the price went to $2.99, we still came because it was still the best in town.  then it jumped to $3.99 and we noticed smaller portions and higher menu prices. . so we stopped coming. . after about 6 month or so we stopped last night as i was craving that salad bar.  i ordered the hot turkey $8.99 and my partner had the chicken parm sandwich. we then asked to add the salad bar and was told it was now $6.99 to add the bar to a sandwich. so, no salad bar for us.  you can only get the salad bar for $3.99. if you have an entree or order a special. the chicken parm was delicious,  a true winner.  my turkey, was a tiny scoop of mash and bread with a few turkey pieces. . while good, the portion was def smaller than ever. . to say the least i think they probably have lost 3 customers for good,  and yes that salad bar was still looking good but, they took the soup away and now you have to order it from the kitchen instead of it being at the salad area.",4
"i love this place and always come here to unwind after a hard day of work. i am one of many regulars, which should speak for itself. the bartenders always recognize my friends and i and are super friendly, always conversing with us. the food is also great. everything about this place makes it my own personal getaway. they always seem to have specials on beers, which have saved my friends and i a ton of money and have gotten us a lot of free stuff. 

if you are looking for the perfect local bar for some r&r this is the place.",5
"well i finally got to try owen's yesterday and i have to say it was pretty good. i'm usually in this area whenever i go to the dentist or get my hair done and failed to realize how close it was to both of those places for me!! owen's is tucked away in the same strip as the polished nail salon - right across the street from atherton. all this time and i never paid attention!

i got to owen's around 9:45 on a saturday morning and was expecting to be met with a long line but thankfully it was not the case. i placed my order for a standard bacon & egg (no cheese please!) on an everything, a plain bagel (not toasted, only sliced), and coffee. for those three items, my total came to $9.36 which i found slightly ridiculous but whatevs. for the price, i didn't like the fact that there's only two coffee choices - decaf or regular. no flavored coffees to choose from but there's a slew of flavored creamers and half and half cups and sugars.

once you place your order, you move over to the side to wait until your number is called out. even though there was a good amount of people working behind the counter and not too busy, myself and others still had to wait a bit for our orders to be called. as i waited, i saw that they started to get busier and the line to place an order was getting longer. once my number was called, i was very hungry and eager to jump right into my sandwich. i could feel the heat from the sandwich through the bag. and that sucker was hot! like fresh out of the steamer hot. the bagel was nice and chewy but the everything bagel flavor was very underwhelming.

i'm looking forward to going back and trying one of their signature sandwich creations just so i can really get a taste of an authentic owen's bagel sandwich experience.",3
great job cutting my hair.very nice barber's.wounderful place ..great price.if your looking for that hair cut that you want go there.,5
"reasonable prices, excellent drinks, friendly and highly talented bartenders, and a great space to sit and enjoy your drink. really nothing to knock here, much better than a hotel bar should be.",5
excellent cachitos from venezuela. they have the traditional ham cachito and new flavors that are out of this world,5
"even del taco  would taste better than this food. our server was horrible. no common courtsey. did not even refill my glass of water. he was only interested is offering high priced drinks.  
del carbon chicken was dry and bland. i hate paying $20 for a dish when it is no way worth it. mt guest ordered fajitas and he said the same thing. even the salsa served as starter with chips was bad. 
this is a real bad food and for anyone who understand flavors and knows what good food is will agree.  
this restaurant is off my list. not going there again.",2
"i posted this review on google too - that's how much i loved the place!
this store is awesome! this was store #7 for me as i was searching for my gown so i know my stuff. we were stuck in traffic & showed up about 15 minutes late really aggravated....but as soon as i stepped in i got completely relaxed. our consultant was katerina and she was great! she completely understood what i was looking for and i really liked every dress she picked out for me. she also had a great eye and was able to suggest fab accessories to complete the look. i'm one of those difficult brides who really needs to discuss the dress.....and she completely got me! the appointment wasn't rushed at all. the store was roomy, they had a ton of gowns, it was well lit, clean, comfortable, pretty. it was just a perfect experience and i highly recommend going there (and ask for katerina!)",5
"with a full house at gyu-kaku and an estimated wait time of over 45 minutes, we opted for some good old classic chinese cuisine. 

the foods we ate did not disappoint! we ordered the house fried rice cakes, the spare ribs, xiao long bao, cold noodles, and shao mai. 

they all were really delicious but the cold noodles really stood out for me. i loved their creamy peanut sauce. it was also slightly sweet. it was great!",4
"i wish i could give this place negative stars. we were lured in late night on a friday and were told that the cover would allow me free drinks and my boyfriend one drink ticket. the second we walked in  we regretted it. this place is a total joke. it smelled terrible and the floor was sticky in a lot of areas. 
after we got our first drinks we hung out on the edge of the sorry excuse for a dance floor. there was a couple dancing near us and the gentleman was evidentially sharing his gf's drink- girls had to have red cups- and a bouncer came  by and told him that  he was absolutely not allowed to drink out of the female cups. he then proceeded to purposely slam the cup from the guy's hands to the floor. we were close by and i was the lucky lady who had that drink spilled all over my feet. the bouncer looked at the liquid on the floor and my shoes, said nothing, and walked away. 
we decided to leave at that point but wanted to get me one more drink since we basically paid $40 for only two at that point. i got a watery vodka cranberry and we walked to the balcony to drink it and leave. i had my bf take a sip of my beverage so he could taste how watery it was, and lo and behold the same a-hole  bouncer came out and proceeded to yell-yes, yell- at my bf for drinking out of my red cup. 
we got the hell out of there at that point. don't go here if you want a good time.",1
"finally found a great nail salon in charlotte that i will keep coming back to! convenient -in plaza midwood, great space with plenty of room. very modern and perfectly clean!!! 

pricing is very fair and on average with across charlotte. welcoming & hospitable as soon as you walk in. they took me right on time for my appointment, offered a selection of beverages and helped me with my bag.

good selection of colors that are so organized, much easier than most locations to find what you want.  one of the owners did my pedicure and it was the best pedi i have ever had- polish is perfect, very relaxing and not in a rush. manicure was from another staff member who also did a really nice job!",5
this is a wonderful restaurant. unlimited food. 4 stars because i have to pay for refills on soda. bottomless drinks would be wonderful. maybe an extra 20 dollars on the bill for bottomless drinks.,4
"this place is kind of depressing. i came here on a friday evening around 5pm and me and my party were the only customers.. not one other!

the game was fun, but after awhile it got repetitive. i was expected a second floor or a much larger space, but it was just a big room.",3
"this was a cute little spot off whites rd and 401 in durham. the service was great and the place had a casual atmosphere.

i got the red curry shrimp. great presentation and it was delicious! a good number of actual shrimp. i'm saying that because i usually get just a couple when i order any shrimp curry at a thai spot. the only con? the menu had 2 chillies next to this menu item. i asked for it to be spicer (3 chilly level) and they did not deliver on that. didn't feel like the chilly level was exceedingly spicy at all - more like a one chilly level. regardless, tasty, well priced and a great experience. 

also, a co-worker asked them to make accommodations for her meal. the waitress went to the back and asked and they happily made those accommodations.",3
best kept secret in biltmore area. everything was excellent. we came with a newborn and the restaurant was quiet enough that she slept all the way through dinner. our party was very surprised at such a great meal in an embassy suites hotel. which by the way was a great place to stay. very clean reasonably priced and facilities not too spread out.,4
great job both steve and justin replaced faucet in kitchen and repaired front door lock without having to buy new set. timely efficient and reasonable expense. what more could i want ?  i recommend them both,5
"got locked out of my house on a sunday afternoon in june - so needless to say, it was 110 degrees out. i called and spoke with the owner who informed me he would call one of his guys and get back to me asap. i received a call within 2 minutes and was quoted approx 30 mins until arrival, and $85 cash to unlock the door. craig was out locksmith. very polite and professional. we were back in our house in no time! 
i didn't take the time to shop around for prices so i'm not sure if they have the best deals or not, but the ease and quickness of service made it worth while!",5
"i come in regularly to place pick up orders!  my favorite is the two meat combo + 1 side.  i like to change up the meats that i order but always get the side salad with house vinagrette as the side.  my meal is complete!  

as far as my current favorite protein goes:

the thai sausages tops the list!  we were able to sample this during a special yelp event, mmm!  the other sausages are good but can be considered walking in a marathon race to catch up to the thai sausage.  next favorite protein is the whole bbq chicken with the pineapple jerk sauce.  

the owner, phil, is a really cool guy.  he will explain the effort into making everything that's served.  and there's a lot to talk about, especially the different types of wood used to create the different added flavor!  

keep up the great flavor lv grille!",4
"less than marginal pizza. i placed an order for delivery and my pizza arrived at room temperature. when i called because the driver was late, the staff member that answered the phone said ""he just left five minutes ago"" so my pizza should have been delivered hot.",1
"our remodel included a complete re-do of the master bathroom, two guest bathrooms, repaint entire house and an update of the fireplace wall. we interviewed several contractors but we decided on ccr due to the professionalism of praveen and his team. each person, especially the project designer haleigh, on the team is extremely responsive and easy to work with. they listen to the client's needs and make sure you are satisfied with the progress and end result. i have not yet met another business owner as passionate as praveen so i trusted he will deliver the end result i am happy with. overall the quality of the work was good and they are willing to come fix any problems as necessary after the remodel. i recommend ccr to anyone who is looking for a dependable contractor. great job team!",5
"sehr vielfältiges und leckeres frühstücksangebot. im sommer eignen sich vor allem sich die sitzmöglichkeiten außerhalb des cafes ideal, um ein wenig sonne zu tanken. an wochenenden ist das seyffers leider immer ziemlich voll, so dass man mit längeren wartezeiten rechnen muss bzw. darauf, dass man überhaupt einen tisch ergattern kann (aber dafür können die betreiber ja nichts).",5
my washer hasn't worked in 2 months and they repaired it in a day! recommend! 5 stars!!,5
"nice spice aroma and flavor in the pho compared the other places i have been to in las vegas. pretty standard beef cuts everywhere. no one seems to use hanging tender beef cuts. it's so tender and flavorful compared to the flank cuts.

after putting in the veggies the soup was still hot. a big plus there. very few places seems to get the concept that the soup should be piping hot when served.

spring rolls and egg rolls seems kinda standard. at least the egg rolls came out hot and crunchy.",5
"i have an expensive electrolux vacuum that i haven't used in several years, because the cord at the top of the vacuum split in half, and the wires inside are burnt. recently, i decided to fix this once wonderful vacuum.
i first brought it to park ridge vacuum at scottsdale road and shea. i was not impressed (that review will be under park ridge vacuum). since the owner of park ridge said it wasn't worth his time to fix my vacuum, he referred me to this place called, complete vacuum.  i went down to complete vacuum hoping they could help. 
the store was dead, and it seems only one elderly man works there.the elderly man is quite odd. i got weird vibes from him, and wasn't very confident about leaving my vacuum there, but figured i'd at least get an estimate. he gave me an approximate estimate of ""at least $50"".
i told him do not fix it, until he tells me a definite cost. he told me he'd call me in a couple of days.

thankfully, i called him 2 days later, because he told me some guy from the other side of town was going to be coming tomorrow to fix my vacuum. that baffled me, as i had told him to call with an estimate first, and do not fix it until i know what it would cost. 

it was hard to have a conversation with him. he seemed a little off. he told me it would be around $120 to fix it, and i felt that was too high, so i told him i would just come pick it up. he then told me if i wanted it fixed, to bring $120 down to him. (what?!) . i told him again i would just come get it. 
he seemed angry, and made me very, very nervous. he gave me the feeling he wasn't going to give my vacuum back. i raced down there as soon as i could, because they were going to be closing. thank god i was able to get my vacuum back, although the entire cord assembly was completely gone off my vacuum. i ran out of there as fast as i could. i don't know what this man's issue is, but i would never deal with him again. i do not recommend this place.",1
"we rented one of their rv's to take our four kiddos to the grand canyon over 4th of july this year.  we won't make that mistake again.  neither tv's audio was working and they knew that when we picked up rig.  told us it was probably the dvd player, so we hooked up r's and still no sound.  we had 2 duck tape a speaker bar 2 the tv then run extension cord ghetto taped 2 ceiling so the kids could actually hear their movies on the long drive.  this place didn't even pro rate the daily fee.  junk!",1
such nice workers and very fast service. it's not a nightmare like every other dmv. i had to talk to four employees but each one was helpful and patient.,5
"the place is pretty but the staff is questionable. first of all only one in the entire place speaks fluent english, the one who did my pedicure only knew a few words. that i can get over, what i can not gat over is that she burned my foot with the hot lava towel. i got first degree burns on the top of my foot. my skin was red and iterated and almost blistering. to that she tried to pat it like it would make it better. no one in that entire place gave a shit that they burned me.",1

"if i could give the platinum 4.5 stars i would! just spent 3 wonderful nights here.  let me preface this review by stating we were looking for an upscale hotel that would allow our 2 small dogs. we found the platinum accepted dogs with a $75 non refundable deposit which we found to be fair.

before hitting the pros and cons, let me state that all the employees at this establishment ""gets it""...they completely understand that their customers keep their hotel running and it shows!  as this hotel has no gaming income, they understand the need to treat their visitors like vip's and they did that for our visit.

as we drove in, we were met bt valet persons julian & roger. julian took our car and roger took our bags. both persons were up and interested in assisting us. it was great that bith julian and roger knew our name when we pulled in or valet service. a big thumbs up there! very personalized service.

most os the reviews are accurate re location, etc.

room was great. upgraded by front desk for strip view...amother thumbs up. great room, beautifil ss appliances, very roomy. first time we have ever had a fridge and microwave and they really came in handy for leftovers and snacking.

my only con to the room...a large stain on rug from other dogs. now, i understand that if you dont have a pet you will most likely not get this room. it only makes sense that certain rooms are for guests with pets, so this our only small complaint.

otherwise, the room was very clean and fresh. we were very comfortable. hvac was very nice. very quiet, never saw any others on the floor.

bottom line, would i stay there again or recommend the platinum? yes, in a heartbeat. their outstanding staff made for a very nice getaway. nordstroms customer service at a macy's price. management should be proud that their employees were really special.

oh, almost forgot, once we got settled, a knock on the door and 2 dog beds with toys arrived! just another small sample of how little thoughtful things are what makes a stay memorable...i know platinum mgmt is reading this, so ""job well done""  ;)",4
"great food & friendly service. food was mouth watering!  ribeye was cooked perfectly, steamed and sautéed veggies done just right. must try the lobster mac!!",5
went here for two breakfast burritos the service was good the burritos were made very well and tasted great.  i have not been back to try anything else but sure will be in the near future.,4
"best indian food i have ever had. we had the tikka masala fries which were to die for..tasted like an indian version of chili cheese fries. we also ordered the chicken makhani...which was recommended to me by the owner who was featured on triple d's. the makhani was perfect curry. creamy richness with a slight spicy kick. being from nyc and the tri state area, this place has perfected indian food to the finest.",5
"let's be honest: health insurance may be the most morally bankrupt of our major industries.  even the well-intended affordable care act is the equivalent of putting a mere bandage on a spurting arterial wound.

and physicians plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for that bandage. 

you may not have a choice in your health insurance providers, which is fine.  dealing with physicians plus, however, is like pulling teeth.

and physicians plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for those tooth extractions.

we had a baby in september.  it's april now, and i'm still getting bills for standard procedures that have been denied by physicians plus (sometimes for the flimsiest of reasons).  i've had to submit several bills multiple times.  they'll cover eventually, but they'll try to wear you down (physicians plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for chronic fatigue treatment).  if i were cynical, i'd think they deny claims as a matter of course in hopes that their customers will just give up hope (physicians plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for depression treatment).  

all in all, you may not be able to avoid them, but they have been incredibly frustrating to deal with.  i'm happy that they are no longer our family's provider, and i hope that i can stop dealing with them before our daughter's first birthday.  i'm tempted to send them a little ""sample"" in the mail (physicians plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for the sample jar).  

i may just take that expense out of pocket.",1
"exactly what i have come to expect from a hilton property. room was clean and quiet...updated... and i am really digging the new easy alarm clocks. breakfast was buffet style and the staff was exceptional. everyone was chipping in to make sure everyone had what the needed and in a very timely fashion. the made to order eggs is always a bonus.  i do wish the cottage cheese was iced as it was a little too warm for my taste both days, but otherwise everything was good. i will be staying here again for my next trip to middleton. what i really like is the shops and restaurants within walking distance... enough to choose from to please almost any palate.",4
"good, quick food. a little pricey for fast food but still in range of current prices.  the new bbq beef brisket was good but had no bbq on it.  good thing i got arby's sauce.",4
"love this starbucks!  ordered sandwich and frappacino. sandwich came out on a plate delivered by friendly employee. fraps were in a glass!  
outdoor seating is covered. nice!",5
"super cutie ambiance.. delightful customer service. the waitress' worked as a team it seemed.. serving all the tables.. one took our order another one brought us condiments, then the first one brought our drinks.. as soon as we were seated we immediately were poured water by josh. i had both my children and though the place is extra trendy they accommodated my kids very well. 
food was above average. i had the kale mushroom chorizo omelette.. chorizo was a little to salty for my taste. but the kale was cooked very well! bf had the carnitas skillet.. again above average taste. portion wise though he could have had more, but not a big deal. my son had the croissant sandwich w\/maple bacon; egg was fluffy and he ate a whole half.. which for a 7y\/o was more than enough. the issue was w\/my daughters chicken tinga omelette. :\ she got about halfway through it and then she discovered egg shells. seemed very strange but we let the waitress know she offered another plate, but it would have been a waste. so she just took it off our bill. not sure what that was about, but overall enjoyed the white chocolate iced latte and hope to be back with the bf for a cute breakfast date.",4
best place for craft beer. perfect to stop in and grab a 6 pack. staff knows what's trending and owner is helpful. love this place.,5
"nice family run establishment. gave the stars on just shear effort. they are short on team members, and could use help. orders took awhile to come out, and our baby was getting uneasy at it got later in the night. 

as for food. the fish was good, and just a tad heavy on sauces. overall good experience, and wouldn't shy away from coming back to see if they have improved. give'em a try.",3
***stay clear**** stay clear*** talk about a used car salesman. i contemplated writing this review but i wouldn't wish this upon any family. had my vehicle for three weeks. i had to take it back twice thereafter to keep fixing leaks. he over promised and under delivered. i learned my lesson from this place.,1
"located in the ballantyne hotel, i've not had a bad thing in the place. if the gallery weren't inside the ballantyne hotel i'm sure more people would go. 

you don't have a view of the golf course so don't plan on see it while dining. if you want to stay out of sight (spy stuff!) you had sit around the back corner.

they have a nice sized private room that holds 13-15 and closes off from the rest of the restaurant if you need a private room.",4
"my husband and i ate here around 10am on tuesday morning. it wasn't too busy and we were seated right away. some guy took our drink order and then we waited quite a while for someone to take our food order. i ordered the eggs with potatoes and a bagel with cream cheese. my husband got a western omelette with cheese. i believe the oj is squeezed fresh because it was delicious. a large is $7, but no shocker in vegas.

our food arrived pretty quickly. my eggs were sunny side up, but 2 out of three still had some runny white parts, so i sent them back. they returned quickly and were perfect. the eggs were yummy, the potatoes had great seasoning and weren't greasy at all. my bagel was so tasty and the cream cheese was amazing. i realized i'd probably never had cream cheese that wasn't from philadelphia's box, so i really enjoyed it. my husband said his omelette was really good and our waitress was very nice, so we were happy. i would definitely go back.",4
"i've attempted to pick up some juice here on multiple occasions over the course of the last few weeks with no success. for a business that claims to make everything fresh on a daily basis, they sure need to improve their supply chain! 
tip for the owner: invest in a juicer, pick up some fruits and veggies at the grocery store, and get to work!",1
"this is my new favorite place for mexican food.  you can tell immediately that the ingredients are fresh and of the highest quality.  the recipes definitely have a more personal and traditional taste, than the cookie cutter offerings that you get from the chain stores like chipotle and qdoba.  there's also a really casual and friendly vibe that make you feel welcomed.  i'm a big proponent of supporting local businesses and when you have a place like this, that obviously cares about their product and especially about their clients, it's really easy to do.  this is my friday night spot.",5
this was a recommendation from my nephew in our way home and i'm glad i took it! very new i've never seen this before and this is a great concept! all the flavors they offer are fantastic! my first one i tried was the shinobe and i loved everything about it!  this takes shaved ice to another level! definitely a most go! #kumasnowcream,4
"one of my fave pho places in las vegas. the food comes out fast and the dishes are tasty. it's hard to steer away from my usual pho tai, but when i do i go for the bun bowls. i'm always stuffed to the gills when i leave and usually go home for a nap. msg? yeah... maybe but it's so worth it.",4
"returning customer, had eaten here many times now and the quality is amazing as well as the service for the price. not much of a wait time either, definitely recommend coming here for your kbbq craving :)",5
they have one open at ph and the other palms...went here just for brunch and dinner...boy were the sandwiches good...the girls had their salads and soups...tomato basil i think and some strawberry cranberry salad both were to their expectations and thats saying a lot coming my picky eaters...i had the turkey sandwich in the morning and now had the roast beef both were very good. the customer service was awesome even though we had a hard time communicating.,5
"for all you instagrammers, you now have a new pic to add: 7 magic mountains.  or if you speak the hashtag lingo, it's #7magicmountains

to get here from the interstate 15n (coming from la) get off the gold strike exit and make a left on las vegas blvd and go down locally for about 10-15 minutes and it'll be on the right hand side. (yes, it's on the northbound side) there is a dirt parking lot and you will have to walk about 100 yards.

"i went in this past friday after work and had a manicure and pedicure done. there was no wait and the lady that did my nails did a great job. the prices were very reasonable, too. the salon is clean but kind of in an area not surrounded by many other businesses without a big sign, so it could be easy to miss. overall, it was a nice experience and i would return.",4
first time ordering. food was ok. restaurant was questionably dirty. there was nothing remarkable about the food. workers were quick and friendly,3
"hello..
 we eat here at least once a week. we enjoy their pizza and brunch. specific items only, as this place can be over priced. there is a server named tom who is severely lacking the ""service industry"" bone... he is by far the worst server there. he has ruined several of our experiences. to the point that we specifically request to not be seated in his area. when we complained about him we were told that he is apart of the owners family. despite the many complaints he is still in the front of the house. so sad. his communication skills are more suited for the computer world.
today is mother's day and i brought my family there to eat. the food was cold and we were surrounded by flies inside of the restaurant. horrible first time experience for my family. we keep trying to give cibo the benefit of the doubt but we are running low on chances as of now. 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer. the service and quality of food is not consistent.",2
absolutely fantastic! we were served a three course meal while solving the crime. we had so much fun and definitely want to do a private event some time soon! feel free to check out my review at wildish jess dot com.,5
"oh thai house, you just get me!

my boyfriend and i recently just moved to st rose and eastern and have been trying every single thai restaurant in the area. every...single...one. guess who wins! thai house!!! their curries are the dankest of all dank. the extra friendly staff makes us feel like regulars already. the thai tea is on point. nothing to complain about here!",5
sometime went there .... ok food .... goos service !! the owner (lady) very nice !!,3
"food is outstanding, clean and refreshing atmosphere. a peaceful break from the strip. highly recommend the burger or the beef bulgogi. service was excellent and very accommodating.",5
love the food but we are freezing our butt off. need to do something about the fireplace not working and turn up the heat.,3
"first impression:
the guys here were borderline rude to me when i dropped my car off. i thought i had talked to someone on the phone and made an arrangements. it turns out there are two monro muffler locations on penn ave and no employee at either shop thought to bring this up (then, or at any point), as i had called the wrong location (i found out days later).

service:
they took my car in anyway and said ""they'd get to it tomorrow"", well tomorrow became the next day and the day after... 

got a call that the mufflers i bought for the car turned out to be the wrong ones so i called around, tracked down the right ones, and dropped the correct ones off there within two hours of the call.

quality of work:
all in all it took a week for them to get the work done and i was under the impression they would be welding the whole system together. it turns out they just use clamps and bolt stuff together. i asked them to make me some tail pipes for me with bends over the rear axle and they couldn't do it with 2.5"" pipe, turns out they are incapable of bending anything over 2"" pipes there. instead we agreed it would be easiest for them and cheapest to install short turndown pipes. so really it wasn't a terribly difficult job to be done.

overall impression:
i gave two stars instead of one because they didn't actually break anything or lose my car or burn it down or anything. pricing came in just over what we had agreed on because of the addition of the turndown pipes. i could have saved a lot of money and time and done it myself.",2
"being a long term fan of the bbq place next door, i decided to give this place a try and instantly regretted that when i got my food.
service was very slow, but the people were nicer.
i got a roast pork on rice and almost everything was pure fat, like 20% meat at max. they were even trying.
i was also not a fan of how their sauce was poured so it would sog up the crispy skin but not be able to make it to your rice. 
i think i'm going back to my usual place from now on.",2
don't know what else to say besides: wow. chocolate toffee cake was the best thing i've eaten in my whole state of being.,5
"i've been ogling this place for a while now.  it's tiny, but they put their amazing looking goods right in the window to tempt me every time i pass it on the bus.  so, just my luck the other day when my bus driver randomly stopped when he got into morningside and instruct everyone to take the next bus.  i decided to do the healthy thing and walk... except then i passed by andante and saw the croissants.  oops.

and ooooooooooooooooh baby what a croissant it was. crispy, soft, buttery, moist, beautiful.  the woman who served me was brilliant as well, teasing me for the fact that i'd tried to walk by the shop but the basket full of croissants pulled me back into bakery heaven.

apparently some people say this place has the best croissants in town.  i think i am going to have to agree with them.",5
i expected more than 50% of the show having film clips when he grew up.  this show is only worth $50 or less and a lot of fluff!  i wouldn't recommend it.,3
"fabulous burgers,  the bison burger is amazing,  staff are friendly and helpful bartenders are hysterical and western town is a lot of fun for children and adults",5
"once again i hobble in to see kathleen and walk out! she's amazing! i've gone to many different chiropractors over the years and she's the best! she does the more gentle form of adjustment which doesn't feel like much at the time but wow is it effective! for those of you that are scared of a forceful back cracking, fear not. it's a gentle tapping hooked to a computer which realigns your vertebrae perfectly:) she also does electro stimulation when my muscles are locked up and lays me on a traction table which i personally adore. 
without kathleen there's no way i could train as hard as i do and keep going, especially as a newly 40 year old woman! lol she keeps me in the gym, on the jiu-jitsu mat and feeling young!
i'm very thankful to have found such a sweet, reliable, professional and talented chiropractor and if you choose her i think you will be too:)",5
"nice venue at night, but way too crowded - most likely over-capacity when we went? they were running a promo where girls drink free from 10 - 11 pm, and it was nearly impossible to get the attention of any of the scantily-clad bartenders. also, be warned - women in vegas, when tempted with a free drink, are extremely catty. so that's fun to be around.

the dance floor was meh; the best parts of the club were the library (one of the top floors, that plays oldies like the beatles and has a cool lounge-like 50s setting), and the outdoors pool area (although the seating is essentially non-existent, all reserved for vips and heavily guarded by bouncers). the drinks are stiff, and run around $13 each.

be prepared to climb a lot of stairs and have a wallet that is weeping quietly by the end of the night.",3
"vibe 
it's about time toronto got back some sort of night life. i love that it's in the east end and that it is has a relaxed vibe. it doesn't take itself too seriously. but is it just me or does this place remind you of calgary? (in the best way...sometimes you need a bit of calgary because surely the toronto scene ain't working. hint: the ""entertainment district.""). 

service wise: 
so our group of ten had a bit of a snafu on the service front - we booked a table over a week in advance and we still had to wait an hour to get a table on a friday night. that said, the staff dealt with it with aplomb. their reservations system was messed up and i hope that they've been able to deal with the snafu. they gave us drinks and their wait staff more than made up for it with quick service. they were also very apologetic for making us wait and they really did make up for it. repeat customer! 

that said, if you have a reservation for a big group, check the day of to make sure it's a-ok. another note if you haven't figured it out: weekends get busy so i'd go on a weekday especially if you're hosting a group for a meal. this is a loud bar but there are plenty of cute boys here. (so this is where they're hiding!). 

ps line dancing? awesome! 

we drank\/ate 
the rusty albertan is my go-to. great drink! 
i like it way better than the grandma's texas lemonade. i felt it was a bit weak to be honest. 

the chilli was good and a good price at $9. curious to try the beer-fried chicken. 
that said, it would be nice to have some ""non"" fried things on the menu. 

obligatory catchy remark 
break out the cowboy boots and plaid! this is the new place to imbibe even if it resembles western canada (kidding!).",4
"this place may become one of my favourite pubs to drink at in edinburgh. i have only visited twice and on both occasions it was very busy though miraculously managed to find a table to sit at. one hiccup was when the waitress originally ask us to move as they forgot to put a table reserved sign but she was very apologetic and offered to find us an alternative table so no harm done. 
some quirky decorations with an antique kinda feel, out of the ordinary drinks on the menu and very appealing food menu.
drinks at the bar were being served quickly as the bar was well staffed and liked how friendly everyone was despite being very busy. 
top marks for their choices of gins, i liked their caorunn and monkey 47, i don't pretend to be a gin expert but it was delightful! one thing though their menu was puzzling to read... at that stage i was sober, i can only imagine having a few too many and staring at the cocktail menu to finally give up ordering a cocktail for being too much effort decrypting!
the food was delicious, my friend and i struggled picking something off the menu as all sounded amazing so we ended up sharing. fillet steak sandwich served with peppercorn sauce was perfectly seasoned and cooked, very tender and my personal favourite. the veggie burger with butternut squash, coriander and chunky chips was also flavoursome and very lush. 
as a still fairly new place i honestly believe they are doing very well at keeping me delighted in coming back. so i might well get jolly sometimes soon at jb.",4
really great mellow mushroom. staff are fantastic especially with kids. great pizza and kids meals are good value and they have them come out first which is great. on friday and saturday's they have a ballon animal guy in who makes creations for tips. really great way to make a meal out even more fun for kids,5
"no matter how many times i've been here or called - the front end staff are completely incompetent, disinterested and downright rude. this actually stops me from booking appointments with my favorite massage therapist.",1
"highly not recommended: ""they"" say there is a first time for everything. and there is also a last time. today was probably both times for me at the tea light cafe. 

after ordering our food, we were presented with the option of eating outside in 100+
degree temperatures or waiting for someone to clean the only 4 top table open. we elected the latter of the 2 options. after patiently waiting for someone to clean the table i finally cleaned it myself. ok. not too bad but not what i expected. 

our food came out lightening fast!  as i took the first bite of my egg roll, i was in heaven!  it was delicious. next, i took a bite of my beef and it was ice cold. i asked my wife how hers was and she said cold. it dawned on me that while i was putting the dirty dishes left on the table by the previous occupants, i noticed a cart with 2 pre-made lunched that were exactly like ours. seeing this was my first time to tea light cafe, i thought maybe our meals were supposed to be cold. i asked the guy that dropped them off if that was the case. he said no and that he'd be right over to fix it. 

he scooped up our meals and came back a few moments later. our meat was warm but it was as tough as shoe leather. my wife stated the obvious, they reheated our meals and presented it to us. too bad, as that is the worst thing a restaurant can do. 

i think we caught them on a bad day, as the foot traffic was nonstop.",1
"i stopped in this week for a quick bit to eat. this was my first visit to the lodge. the service was good - but the food was not. 

i ordered the beef fajitas against my better judgement given i wasn't at a mexican restaurant, and he ordered some typical bar food. honestly, i wasn't expecting five star fajitas, but what i got contained large amounts of beefless gristle. since the lights were dim, it wasn't easy to separate the gristle from beef. it made the fajita experience unfavorable because the fajitas could not be eaten as intended. i ended up picking through the hot plate for what was edible. 

the atmosphere was smoky even in the dining room since service goes through the bar from the dining room adjacent door. the salad was fresh and good. the iced-tea was refreshing.",1
"3.5 stars...

i guess 2014 has now seen the 3rd round of cutbacks (i have been coming here for years so it's only why i notice)...if you look at the pics of some awesome looking stuff and expect to see it on the buffet you'll notice the pics were most likely from 2009-2010

round 1 (2009)
take away the king crab...replace with snow crab
take away rack of lamb...replace with lamb loins
round 2 (2012)
take away lamb loins...replace with kobe beef
round 3 (2014)
take away kobe beef replace with street tacos

also some obvious replacements were a huge ramen noodle station in place of something i forgot what used to be there. didn't see one person in the whole 90 minutes get an entire bowl of ramen noodles...because you just paid $40 to eat more expensive food..so why would you?

the fish was way overcooked...all 3 different fish that i tried. mahi mahi, blackened salmon, even the sea bass...and it's hard to overcook sea bass.

the prime rib was decent.

yeah, i'm doing a lot of complaining because it's not what it used to be in it's heyday but what really saves this place are the desserts. probably the best buffet desserts in town (aside from bachannal)...high quality desserts (see pics). throw in a strawberry crepe and 3 profiteroles and that capped off my 8000 calorie meal. 

i really thought of giving this place 4 stars due solely on desserts but if i gave it 4 stars, did the 2006 version of the wynn buffet deserve 7 stars?

""a-ok"" i'll be coming back.",3
"i stumbled upon this place by accident - i'm not a local, but enjoy drinking anyplace off the strip where people are just relaxing and having a good time.  it's a good place for either a quick drink or spending the evening with friends.  it has recently been remodeled and has a nice clean atmosphere.  

there was a small mixed crowd when i visited; everyone was friendly and having a good time.  we were all enjoying the cool mix of techno, blues and oldschool rock.  it was just my style.  the bartender was hot and friendly and the drinks were great too.

there there is a nicely-sized bar in the center with a few tables around the walls.  there is a large adjoining room that would be perfect for gatherings, or to belt out some tunes during karaoke on wednesday nights! there are plenty of hd tv's for sports and other entertainment too.

the biggest surprise was the excellent food.  they serve a full menu of mostly asian, but i'm sure you could get most anything you wanted.  i tried the shrimp pad-thai, upon recommendation of the barkeep (shoutout to daisy :) and it was, very good.  the prices are fair and the quality was high.  they even have little wooden trays that sit on the edge of the bar, so you can continue your video poker play while you eat.  i love it!!!

it's an easy place to get to and there is plenty of parking too.  it's just west of the old sahara, so most of the surrounding area is currently pretty empty.  give it a try, you won't be disappointed.  i know i'll be back next time i'm in town.",5
"this place is good for pie only. went for breakfast today and stood at the front while the hostess was trying to do everything she could to bus tables, answer phones, check for full pies (request from phone call) while the manager walked by and looked at us multiple times without saying anything.  finally, i asked her whether we could sit.  

after ordering a very basic meal of eggs, hash browns, and toast: it took 38 minutes for the food to come.  when it did, it clearly was sitting for awhile as the bread was soggy and cold, the eggs were luke warm, and the bacon was fatty.  my son's eggs had jelly below them on the plate and inedible.

we didn't have continued time to wait so we didn't ask for new ones, he just didn't eat.  this is the 4th time we have tried this place and it is always slow.  

the pie is good though!",2
we visited joe's this past week and the four of us were very disappointed with the service and meals.  it was not very busy and our server was not very excited to be there. our meals were very overpriced for the quality and quantity of the dish. we were all very excited to try joe's as it's got great reviews but we left very disappointed.,3
"lucky thai succeeds as being my local neighborhood thai shop!!
it's not the best, but i consider it above average which is good enough for me.  

whenever i visit any new thai food place i always order pad thai, not only is it my favorite thai dish, i use it a gauge to rate the restaurant. 

pad thai was pretty good, noodles were soft and stretchy and it had a right balance of sweetness, with deliciously cooked vegetables.  
spice level - 5\/10

spicy pork basil -. i know i'm supposed to eat this with rice, i just pushed that side and practically devoured this. tastes so delicious, spicy and aromatic.   
spice level - 5\/10

tom yum soup -  i'll give it props it cleared up my sinuses!! it had distinct hot and sour flavors, i enjoyed drinking the the basic broth full at the end of rich herbs and spices.

great drinks either hot or cold. fast wi-fi. only thing i would suggest is putting a few more tables on the second level.,4
"we stayed here for a small weekend getaway for our anniversary.  while the hotel was under construction, we really were not impacted by it.  we checked in on friday and while the lobby is super tiny (maybe due to construction) there was no wait and we checked in easily.  the floor we stayed on was where the gym is going to be, but we did not hear any construction.
our room was very nice and very clean.  a great size with a very comfortable bed.  there was a small problem with the room at first but our bellhop and front desk person fixed it very quickly.  all of the staff was very friendly, especially the people working the valet and front of the hotel.  
the hotel is in walking distance from most places we wanted to go including shops, casino, ballparks, sightseeing and great resturants & bars!
very relaxing and enjoyable stay.  ""the land"" seems to be growing on us.",5
"had a wonderful first time experience dining here tonight. our server, cc, was such a sweetheart and was great! she checked on us thoroughly and made sure we were happy and all set with everything we had ordered. i had the pollo fundido, and let me tell you.... when it comes to pf, i am picky. this was the best pollo fundido i have ever had. i will definitely be back and hope cc is our server again :)",5
"dude wtf are they doing to the mac salad??

for real its like the creamiest mac salad ive ever had, which coupled with the b health rating kinda makes me nauseous, but in a good ""don't tell me, i don't wanna know, this sh*t is bomb"" kinda way.

portions are big.

best items i tried were the terry chicken and the mac salad!

one of the best terry chickens ive had, and ive had a lot trust.

hang loose braddah! i gotta life time ah knowledge",4
"we had fun at the cne.
we loved the aerial acrobatics and ice skating show at ricoh coliseum. it was absolutely fantastic. 
the food building had some decent vendors. 
there were rides and games, which were good too.
knick-knacks from around the world in the international pavillion, which was very interesting.

canadian armed forces display was pretty cool too. you can sit inside and take a picture in f-18 fighter plane, get in the back and on top of a lmv, wear the canadian army outfit and feel proud about it.

there were many virtual reality games in the innovation garage.
children would also enjoy the animals on the farm (pigs, hen, turkey, llamas, cows). the farm was quite informative as well.

warehouse outlets are a waste of your time. the stuff is cheap quality\/poor design and you would need too much of your time to find anything you would like to buy. you would be better to skip these.

sand sculptures and butter sculptures were good too.

we went this saturday when the weather forecast said it'll be brutally hot, so we avoided too much rush.",4
"the food is good for the price, $10.95 + drink. the qualify of the food is pretty good. the steak station was awesome, steak any way you want whether you want medium rare, medium, etc... the salad station very fresh.  the service is great, the waitresses come and clean up often and refills your drink for you.

major con: the wait is around 2 hours long!!!! be prepare to wait for a very long time and don't get too anxious once you get inside, there's another 30 minutes wait inside.",3
great place to get your phone fixed!!  got my phone fixed here and it's working fantastically!  great price and they even price matched it! thank you!! got it fixed in less than an hour :),5
"my friend suggested we come here because we were looking for a late night dessert place. we came on a friday night around 10 or so and we were surprised that this place was so busy! there's about 6 or so tables and then a bar table at the back for people to sit. we told the person behind the counter that we were a party of 4 and she started to clear out a table for us.

she brought us the menus and took time to explain all the desserts that they're known for. their soufflés take 40 minutes to bake, but it was definitely worth the wait. we ordered a lemon soufflé, a vanilla soufflé, a matcha latte, a lychee tea, and a cheesecake soufflé slice. we also ordered a chocolate soufflé about 10 minutes after the first order, but they came back and said that they ran out of soufflés (or the ingredients to the soufflés).

the soufflés were incredibly moist! they definitely taste like a very light japanese cheesecake. the lemon one had a very light lemon custard inside, but the vanilla one was very fluffy and airy inside. the vanilla one comes with your choice of sauce, so i had the guava sauce, which was very sour so i didn't use too much of it. my favourite was the cheesecake soufflé slice that came with a strawberry syringe.

service was very friendly! we had forgot a bag inside the cafe and she ran outside and brought it to us. she also brought us some glasses of water, but it was hot water for some reason. i think they were washing dishes with hot water from the tap and just have us water from the same tap after. if you ask for iced water, they'll bring you actual cold water (so ask for that specifically in case). ask for their wifi password and they will give it to you on a card. there's also lollipops and each table!

food: 3\/5
service: 5\/5
i don't know if i would come back, but if i do, i'll definitely just order the cheesecake soufflé next time!",4
really great people! we were visiting from california and our dog had some complications with bladder stones. they were super helpful and stayed late just to take care of our dog. dr. jones was professional and kind. thank you!,5
"the wynn was the best  hotel i've ever stayed at! i stayed there for two nights during it's opening year. okay, okay, i didn't pay for the room....because my friend received a complimentary room.

everything in the hotel was great! the room, service, decor, and buffet were all fantastic!

"for years i have bought used high end cars that i could not ever afford to purchase new. i have a dealer that watches for bargains. i only get a new used car about every 10 years. so last spring i get a call, that a 2003 lexus 430 sc with 30,000 miles was available. i was overdue for  a trade, and in my advancing years wanted a hard top convertible, actually i had grown a bit weary of having to repair the ragtop of my bmw 325. since cleantown usa opened, i've taken my cars there. the staff has always been attentive, managers were thoughtful and sincerely wanted to know if the cleaning had been done well. no one ever hesitated to go back over an area to spiff it up if it had been missed.

i took the lexus there yesterday. had the deluxe wash and interior cleaning. i got into the car and came home. every few days i carefully wipe the road dust off the car. when i came home yesterday, i did a quick wipe to admire the clean car, before the next rain. ""ahhh!, there is something all over 1\/2 of the trunk. it looks like a chemical that changed the surface of the paint!"" i garage my car at home and work. i could only think something had happened at the car wash, otherwise i would have surely seen this heartbreaking change in the appearance of a car immaculately kept. i called cleantown. without hesitation the said to bring it out. i was met by ryan and dan, two of the managers. they diagnosed the change due to drippings through concrete in work's parking garage {shadyside hospital]. they told me of several products that might help, and the risks to using some of them. then they took the time to try a number of products to restore the disfigured paint, the first two efforts didn't due to well. ryan said he thought he knew just what to use that would be safe. he retrieved a squeeze bottle from the wash area and went to work. wow! the chemical reaction on the clear coat was gone! he kindly finished clearing every splatter, waxed the area and sent me on my way, very relieved!

i will be back of course, and this spring i will have ryan's crew due restoration on the finish of the whole car. i promise you that this isn't an advertisement, just a happy, evermore loyal cleantown fan. thanks so much guys!

"highly recommended: this is a great hidden gem.  teharu is not your typical north scottsdale frilly and fuss sushi bar.  it's low key and extremely easy on your wallet.  if you are looking for fancy, this is not the spot that will satisfy you.  if you are looking for inexpensive sushi, this is your spot.

they utilize a conveyor belt system to deliver fresh sushi throughout the restaurant.  we were not familiar with this method and by the time we had pulled a few items off the belt and finished them, we flagged down a waiter to find out how to keep track of what we had already eaten.  it turns out that the plates are color coded with each color representing a set price. blue = $2.00, green = $1.50 and yellow = $1.00

my favorite item on yesterday's visit was the haru popper.  essentially, it is a jalapeño popper filled with ""krab"" and cream cheese. 

the location is easy to get to.  teharu is located on the north east corner of frank lloyd wright blvd at the 101 freeway.  parking can be sparse during lunch hours.

enjoy.",5
"the technician was prompt, fast, super clean (vacuumed the whole car and cleaned all the windows) and very friendly. excellent customer service.",5
this hotel is really mx there were times where the service was it's excellent and the hotel was worth every penny and other times where customer service was completely lacking and the attitude of the employees was horrible. the hotel is starting to age things are not as clean as they used to be rooms are a little beat up and honestly some of the staff seems a little worn out.   i asked for a view and was told there weren't any while my coworker who checked in at the same time next to me was even easily given a great view exact one i asked for. i think next time we will stay somewhere else on the strip.,3
"i've been living at the broadstone waterfront for nearly a year now and have loved every minute of it! i have no complaints and plan to renew my lease for another year. the location is ideal for walking to anywhere in old town and the property is beautiful and is kept very clean. the amenities are great, front office staff is helpful and friendly, and the maintenance team has been incredibly responsive and helpful every time i've called. any issue i've had (very few) has been fixed within 24 - 48 hours. highly recommended!",5
"while visiting charlotte for the dnc, i must say that merts made me feel as if i never left home.  i dined there for breakfast and two dinners.

for breakfast i had two eggs, bacon, biscuits and home fries.  everything was very enjoyable but where merts really shines is at night.

for dinner, i had the salmon cakes on one occasion and the fried catfish on the other.  on the side, i had yams and greens and a sweet tea to wash it all down.  i managed to save enough room for dessert and enjoyed a slice of sweet potato cake.  the cake was moist and delicious and the frosting was nothing short of decadent.

merts portions are huge.  if only my hotel had a mini fridge, i could have taken my leftovers back to my room.

the wait staff is super friendly.  as for its location, merts is very convenient to lots of hotels in downtown charlotte.",4
"bacon was wayyyy too peppery, they should really just call it pepper bacon. the waffle was bland. however the omelet was perfectly cooked and the ingredients were fresh. the home made butter and the syrup made up for the waffles lack of flavor. its nice that everything is fresh and natural but when 50% of all the food is some what bland it doesn't really cut it, and the servers were friendly but are a bit out there. its hard to explain, unique, yet uncomfortable. i saw one waitress get on her knees and put her face right next to a guy ordering as he just stared at her and awkwardly gave his order with the most frightened expression. my dining companions might be back, but i will not be. it just equated into a mediocre experience.",3
"in town today on vacation, wanted to see suicide squad. found this theatre on yelp and decided to give it a try. theatre was nice and in a great area, bars and shopping all around. went for a matinee, prices were cheaper than back home, and staff was friendly. great movie theatre and worth the five stars.",5
"i took a star off cause delivery takes forever but when it shows up it's hot and fresh from my experience. i've ordered the chicken strips, chicken wings, cheese burger and calzone before from here. the calzone was kinda over cooked but it was huge,  enough to feed 3 people. the chicken strips are good and reasonably priced. 

you can also choose what kind of wings and chicken strips you want. they all come with fries unless you get an a la carta or something. they do charge extra for the ranch but you get a big cup of it though, so it's worth the 50 cent. they stay open late as well.",4
"a non-franchise pub in a popular area of central downtown. an easy place to grab a drink or a meal before heading to the theater or a movie. 

dropped by on a monday night for a quick meal and found the place mostly empty. we chose to sit on the bar side (plenty of screens on the latest sports event) and picked some cheap beers to go with the feature meals of the night. my dining buddy had the featured philly cheesesteak sandwich and really liked his meal. i remember liking my meal (but have since forgotten what i got). 

the patio outside looks like a good place to people watch on a sunny day. convenient, predictable and can provide for all your eating\/drinking needs.",3
"grabbed the $10 burger deal with fries and a drink. for drinks, all they had was diet pepsi, water, and monster (saw this after i paid). the lettuce was from a salad package so i had to sift through the carrots, onions, and cabbage to put lettuce on my cheeseburger. the curly fries were ok. nothing special. the burger was drenched in seasoning and was not edible. after the first bite, it went in the trash. waste of $10.",1
"i really enjoyed my experience with the technician while getting my cervical and thoracic spine scanned, he was very thorough and made me feel comfortable. however, upon taking my images to my spinal doctor the following week, they informed me that arista had given me the wrong disk. i had a different patient's brain mri, not my own. in addition to having this event monopolize my one day off that i reserved for seeing my doctor,  it is a huge hipaa violation and their office needs to be more organized. unacceptable.",1
"went to dinner with a friend who had been here for brunch. the cauliflower appetizer was delicious; it was sitting in kale pesto and nuts which i wanted to dump directly into my mouth. i tried one of the pasta dishes for my entrée. the serving size was good as i could not finish it, and it was served with two slices of grilled bread. they even brought another plate of complimentary bread as requested as my pasta had burrata which was good on the bread. the service was a little off, like our server was not very experienced or was fairly new to this restaurant. the overall concept is cool with the main restaurant, bar, and beer garden. i wish they had more happy hour offerings, but i plan on returning one weekend and giving brunch a try. the food is fresh, and you can tell some thought went into the menu.",3
lunch buffet is great!!!  very reasonable.  beautiful atmosphere.  one of my favorite indian food restaurants ever thankfully i live close by.,5

"during the middle of july in 2013 our upstairs a\/c went out.  at the time our son was only a couple months old.  infinity heating & cooling was there the same day and helped repair our a\/c in just a few hours.  we were offered a more cost effective solution that would be covered under our warranty but would take a few weeks to get in.  i loved the integrity of the service.  we decided to go to the more expensive option because waiting to have a\/c was not an option in the middle of july in las vegas.  we have had infinity heating & cooling come back to do preventative maintenance both on the home we owned in north las vegas and now at the home we rent in henderson.  the service, integrity and friendliness of infinity heating & cooling is a huge blessing to our family.  we will continue to turn to infinity heating & cooling for all of our heating and cooling needs.",5
"been here twice, and both times made me feel like i was going to my grandparent's house for dinner. i'm sicilian and quite finicky when it comes to italian food, but this place is the real deal.

it was nice to witness when people walked in the door, john the manager, would greet them by name. this shows me that there are a lot of regulars (repeat costomers) and he has taken the time to get to know his patrons.

now on to the food...

the first visit, i ordered the chicken picata. it was some of the best i've ever tasted. the second time i had the chicken marsala. again, it was very delicious. we also tried the fried mozzarella appetizer, which was placed on a bed of prosciutto and arrugala, and drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. wow! for desert we had canoli and tiramisu. the canoli wasn't like my grandmother's but it was ok.

the only place almost as good as this place is nicks, but that is a distant second.",5
"i found myself suddenly going away for the weekend and i had never boarded my dog before. a friend recommended canine preferred and told me that they are cage free so i decided to give it a try. i never put zion (my maltipoo) in a cage before and that was one reason i never boarded him before. zion came back happy, calm and with an amazing new puppy cut that was exactly what i wanted. i could never imagine diane and her groomers doing anything but the absolute best work. they really love the animals they work with.  customer for life!",5
"i wish that i could give lotus of siam 10 stars. it's that good!!!! 

don't let the exterior or location off the strip fool you. lotus of siam is my favorite restaurant in las vegas (and i'm a vegas native), hands down. it's quite possibly my favorite restaurant period. i follow them on instagram and just drool over every photo.

my typical experience begins with tom yum soup with shrimp. we get a pot for the whole table. i can honestly say you've never had tom yum soup like this. you can taste each ingredient separately, but also all together. it's a symphony in your mouth!!!

i always have a hard time deciding what to get for an entree. the sea bass drunken noodle!!!! is the best thing ever. the tom yum noodle soup (yes, double the tom yum). i once read a review that said that the noodle soup is to tom yum what bouillabaisse is to fish stock. all the curries are amazing. the crisp duck curries are also very popular.

on the northern menu, there is a delicious vermicelli bowl!!!! you can ask for it without tripe.  

next time i'm going to try the soft shell crab! 

they also have an award winning wine list.

the prices are incredible reasonable ranging from 9-15 on average with the sea bass and crab items in the high 20s low 30s. 

you will need to get a reservation a few days in advance, or you can show up 15 mins before they open at 5:30 and be seated immediately.  i can't speak to their buffet.

do not miss out. make this a stop on your vegas trip.",5
"absent a train, this is a fairly easy and painless way to get from yul to downtown.  the buses run frequently and there are plenty of ticket machines to buy your pass. the fare is $9 cash or you can buy an all day fare card and then use that on subways and buses the rest of the day.  

i like the bus at yyz a bit better because it's only $3.  that takes a star off. the other reason it gets dinged a star is because the bus i rode downtown the other day had no air conditioning!   i mean, seriously, where are we?  khartoum?   come on, it's 2013.  i expect ac for my $9.  

otherwise, though, a great way to get downtown. i like how they even have space for luggage.  hear that q33 to laguardia?",3
free breakfast or free booze!? either way..... #winning!,4
"driving along main st., i was pretty excited to see a burrito place here. the greek place next door seemed a little pricey at the moment and so being really hungry, i obviously had to walk in and try it out. the place is clean and brand new and the owners were really nice people. they genuinely want to serve people good food. 

i got myself a large burrito (steak), and a large burrito is what i got. as you can see, it has a couple bites in it but it is still larger than my hand. it was also pretty yummy. i love when my burrito is grilled perfectly so that there is a slight crunch on the tortilla. you can tell the fillings are all very fresh and the meat is seasoned well. it is not overly salty which is good. also, there is free guac! 

pay a visit to this place and i think you will be pretty happy",5
"the new orleans cold-brew iced coffee was easily the best cold brew i've had. the server was the absolute sweetest and knew so much about every single thing that went into the coffee and hartzler's milk. all around great experience, i will definitely go back when i'm in the area.",5
"it's a sports bar - doing what sports bars do! probably assisted by the relationship to olivia's, which is next door (and despite one bad experience, i must admit has incredible food, drinks and service), this place is great. 
wonderful place with wall-to-wall videos of sports - or whatever, they put on dancing with the stars for me, even though i am heterosexual - but the food is simple but great. the deconstructed calamari in fried wonton was great. the hatari burger was better.
also, great pay-by-hour pool tables! 
close to downtown and my neighborhood of huntridge. thanks too to manager jillian wickham for her most welcome hospitality. this place is great and i hope it succeeds!!!
also, stop by olivia's before you go and you can get a coupon for a free tropical mini-pizza. quelle tasty!",5
"great dinner for indulgent breakfast!!!

the menu is entirely in french so good luck and order something you might not know exactly what it is lol!!!

he had the french toast with brie, blueberries, granola and yogurt and almonds. it was served but was way under cooked so he sent it back. the server was apologetic and replaced it quickly.

i had the three musketeers and it was perfect!

they did charge me for the lemon i asked for in my water which was odd.",3
enjoyable happy hour. the little margaritas have a bit of a kick - yea! the beef tacos ($1) were savory and quite a nice bite for the price. happy hour was the reconnaissance mission - we'll try a meal next.,4
justin was our delivery driver and he is fantastic! such a pleasant employee and works hard! he seems to work quite often and is always a pleasure to be greeted by! the pizza is always hot and delicious!,5

"my favorite sushi spot of all time !!!! been coming here since 2011.. unfortunately.. i went 2 days ago & got extremely sick. yes, food poisoning . the other people also had upset stomachs. unfortunately it hit me the worst. i've heard people say the fish is really bad quality. but i didn't care it's just so good ! i'm so disappointed in you yama sushi. putting the health risks of your customers in jeopardy. pleas be careful !!!!!!! will not be going for a long time if i ever do decide to go back. smh.",1
"i just got back from there , i have never been but i'm glad i did it was really cool they had a lot of cool comics and toys , i finally found the toy i have been looking for , if you haven't been there you should stop by you won't regret it !!!!!",5
"i've patronized hayashi for lunch(weekday) and dinner(weekend) half-a-dozen times and sat at the bar or in a booth. i am there for the rolls and and not much else.

there are numerous roll selections. almost too many for my taste.  the rolls are good, although i usually stay away from any cream cheese contained rolls.  the fish tastes fresh. the eel can be too dry. the ""white"" fish used in some rolls tends to be very dry when served tempura style. my favourite roll is the volcano roll: spicy tuna piled on top of rolls. seattle roll is good too.

as far as price, don't kid yourself. $50\/person is pretty average. that's 3-4 rolls and two drinks.  yes, they are $2-$3 more than i'd like them to be but considering the available choices: acceptable.

the place is very busy on the weekends. i've had lunch during the weekday. it provides a great opportunity to ask the sushi chef questions about what is in the rolls and watch them make it. considering the small size of their sushi bar and regular bar, service isn't too bad. i've been told there are plans to construct a larger sushi bar. that's good new for customers.

dave at the bar provides great service. haley is a work horse. smile more haley!!! i've only sat at pua's tables and have nothing but good things to say about her service and roll recommendations.

the one glaring deficiency is the lack of customer service from management. roam the floor, greet the customers, ask about the service and food, offer advice to those undecided on what to order. how about having samples to help entice those who are totally lost.

connect with the customers and we will come back for more.",4
really nice vibe. the drinks are delicious. they have something for every pallette. the servers made the experience. very nice and friendly a very positive dinning experience. the environment is worth the visit but the food will make you come back.,4

"had a great dinner here.  started with the potato leek soup which was great, and then had a steak with garlic spinach.  great food, great service, and a decent bar, though the liquor selection was limited.",4
"i loooove this place! they seem to be doing really well, so i hope they take some of their money to do a few much needed updates.",4
"my review is for cocktails only since we didn't order food during our visit.

i've heard good things about blue martini from coworkers, but had never made my way over until now. it was saturday afternoon and the weather was beautiful so obviously day drinking outside was the logical activity. we also needed new shoes from a store at town square so this was an obvious choice. 

we arrived around 5 on saturday and the hostess told us that seating was open. most of the seating available was at the bar or inside, but we were able to snag one of the few outdoor patio tables available. as soon as we sat down our friendly waitress greeted us and provided waters. she checked in several times while we were there and our waters continued to be filled. 

the drink menu was impressive. they offer plenty of different drinks ranging from martinis to mix drinks to white and red wines. it was one of the lengthier mixed drink menus i've seen lately. 

my pomerita had more of a sweet taste than a boozy taste. it was light for a summer evening. my husband really enjoyed his bombs away. 

this is a nice spot to enjoy a drink with a group or as a couple on a nice evening.",4
"so, not purposely, i ate in two frc's on the same day. modern steak for lunch and greene house for dinner. i would say that time has treated the green house well. it has really found its groove. i have dined here before and this was the best experience so far. 

the menu is varied with options and price points. we were with a group of six and everyone was surprisingly happy with every dish. i had the beet salad and unlike others i have had, this one had about 6-8 small roasted beets chock full of flavor. the greens were plentiful!! a large plate full and the goat cheese and pistachios added nice texture. not sure how they prepared the goat cheese...it was almost the consistency of a mascarpone, yummy! others at the table loved the ahi tacos and tortilla soup. 

i had scallops as my main course and they were cooked perfectly! a great sear on the outside yet tender inside. the julienned peas were really fresh and complimented the dish nicely. the only thing out of place was a crispy piece of bacon on top. the bacon seemed out of place and really unnecessary (albeit perfectly cooked...so much so a lot of breakfast joints should take notice.) others loved the trout and homemade pasta. everything seemed light, with a ca flair. 

oh, and the wine list is reasonable too. only two bottles over $50 and many in the $20 range.",4
tacos were great. not a fan of decor. service was good. would eat here every time i am in vegas.,4
what a fantastic company to work with that had exceptional customer service. they called before they delivered and took it all the way out to the grass. they were prompt on pick up. kind and polite each time. will rent from them in the future! highly recommend.,5
"this place is just around the corner from work-- it has been recently redecorated. it looks very nice now. prices are pretty good, but i come here because linda does an outstanding job on my pedicure!  you can find me here every two weeks!",4
lake las vegas water sports is an amazing experience for the whole family. they have so many options to have fun in the water. they also have some fantastic events like the neon paddle. all the glow gear makes it super fun for all ages! i would recommend them to everyone!,5
"at first i thought cafe novo would be one of those pretentious espresso-only cafes, but it wasn't. they have drip coffee and a nice selection of books to read. a fine place indeed.",4
"omg, delicious pizza. some of the best i've had. however, those pizza logs are not good. wontons and pizza ingredients are not a good mix. also, be sure to have plenty of time when you order. full pizzas are like 25-30 minutes to come out. also, the charbroiled wings are hands down the best in charlotte.",4
"awesome service and even better food! you can't go wrong with this place.
great beer on tap and great happy hour specials.",5
"absolutely a fan of costco. everyone is always friendly, always ready to help or answer your questions. 

the people they have serving the samples are great to chat with. some of them love to bring a joke or two while you wait for them to serve the samples. 

costco is known for the incredible prices at bulk. i recommend the kirkland brands they are definitely a great competitor with other brands and a lower price and high quality products.

pro tip: you don't need a costco membership for the liquor\/beer\/wine

you do need a membership for the gas( which is always a steal of a deal) 
the car wash is amazing and cheap $7.99  and it shines your other tires vs. other do it yourself gas stations charge extra as an add on. 

also the food court always has amazing food and cheap deals for food on the go. 
$1.50 for hot dog and soda",5
"love this hidden place (yes it's at the back of a convenience store)... instead of buying all your veggies and fruits to make a salad (and have most of it go bad because ur only one person)- this place has a whole selection that is already chopped up and ready for you to pick from their buffet style selection!!  you get a choice of a small or large container and you just fill up on the stuff you like... most of the food is healthy; fruits, veggies, tofu, eggs etc. you can add meat or falafel at the counter for protein and voila- a simple healthy meal with no trouble at all...
the value is great for what you get- no more wasting time chopping up veggies for a salad for me anymore :)
i have to add that the lady at the cash is amazing and so so friendly... also super fast and efficient at moving the line very quickly during the busy times which is mainly lunch time during the work week. 
nothing fancy at this place but you're not there for the look of the place but for the food! :)",4
i love to watch a movie here because its comfortable that my hubby fall asleep. recliner leather seats wow! and i can able to purchase and reserve some seats in the website it's so convenient.,4
"first the bread tasted stale, hardly and steak on my sandwich and the cheese tasted like craft singles yuck! one good thing there fries are great.",1
worst indian food we ordered mutterpaneer & malarikofta which was taste less paneer was dry and peas was raw and in malai kofta all they did cut four pieces of fried potato and when i called them that its not kofta owner is like that's how they serve well i've advised that change your chef.,1
"i agree with everything written below by the other tenants and honestly wish i could give them a 0 star rating. i have never in my life dealt with more unprofessional and unethical down right jerks in my life. trying to get in contact with anyone is worthless because they will never call you back. the b*&ch nicole in the office is about as bright as a box of rocks. she will literally ignore you and say she will contact the property manager and get back to you but good luck with that. our landlord is a completely mindless piece of crap and i would never say that about anyone because i try to be above that but this warrants it completely.  the reason they act this way is because their owner is just as slimy and unethical as they are. just read the bbb report responses from the owner and you will see exactly what i mean. 

i wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy and so wish there was a way to prevent others from having to experience the absolute nonsense these so called managers do. 

i would never ever recommend renting or listing your property with these people. i would mention specifics but since we are currently under contract i am avoiding retaliation because i know damn well that would happen. lets just say there are hazards that will cause illness to our family if not fixed immediately. we have left to stay in a hotel until things are repaired and have began speaking with a lawyer. 

it is unreal how these people have complete disregard for their tenants and clients. they care about money and that is it plain and simple. i wish i had something good to say but there is absolutely nothing good even remotely. i feel bad for the owners of the home because the neighbors say they are very nice people. they are going to have costly repairs if these repairs are not made soon and without a response from the property manager or the office it is hard to say if they will be fixed. we have submitted requests in writing via certified mail, over the phone and through text with no response at all. 

the good thing is i record every conversation and copy ever email, text and letter to my external servers. i assure you this is very well  documented and the authorities and attorneys feel confident they are in breach of contract and liable for damages. 

yelp better not remove this post either because this is a real review and not something made out of anger. these are the facts and should be viewed as a warning to all consumers looking to use their services.",1
amazing food!!!! they do make it spicy so order on the lower side of spice if you are not a fan. the food did take a long time to make though as other people have said. don't be in a rush when you come here.,4
"best mariscos! the service is good, the waitress was always making sure we were doing good. we had the agua chiles.... bomb!!!! the micheladas were also tasty. the music that was playing was also good, love corridos!!! i am definitely coming back to this place when i visit vegas!!!",5
"this is my new favorite sushi place for both the food and the people. i have tried the salmon teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, chirashi bowl, half roll platter, salmon ikura bowl, and different nigiri pieces. 

the teriyaki is what you would expect. the bento includes things that are less commonly included like seaweed salad which is a nice touch. miso tastes fresh and has actual green onions slices. they don't have any complicated american-style rolls, but they do have giant pieces of amazing fish quality. i tend to not order salmon in sushi restaurants, but their salmon has great flavor and melts in your mouth. the fresh wasabi is amazing and something you never get at this price point. 

the reason why i keep coming back to this place is the amazingly sweet server. they don't have fountain drinks, but if you finish your can she'll bring out a 'refill.' my table spilled a big beer and she brought over a little one to make up for it. i showed up twice in one day and the chef sent over a little something special.

if you want great food at a restaurant where the people actually get to know you and care about you, this is your place. the prices are amazing for the quality of sushi you're getting, and they do have some cooked specials if you are coming with people who don't go for raw fish.",5
"usually i'd give this location all 5 stars but after this visit, my opinion dropped a star. why? well, first of all because our table was really wobbly and would move whenever we'd lift up our drinks to take a sip, or move anything on the table. second, because it was so freaking cold in there, due to the ceiling fan above us on full speed and the a\/c blowing down. i shivered the entire duration of the meal. 

our friend had to keep reminding the waitress, and the helper who helped serve our food, that he ordered cocktail sauce for his all you can eat fish & chips. it took forever to get that to him! we all got the fish & chips friday special...while it was pretty good, my fries were too done for me to the point i could only finish about half of them...and just having recent oral surgery, i couldn't eat anything super hard or crunchy due to sensitivity and the surgery areas in the process of healing. my fish, however, was just right and i could eat it without fail. 

took home a piece of red velvet cake for dessert. the cake itself was dry and the frosting was perfect. i was rather disappointed. also, the floor inside the restaurant was slick and felt greasy. that itself is a safety hazzard.",4
"one of the best local spots for lunch. the venue was spotless, service was excellent and the dishes are mouth watering!",5
"i love checking out new places, and yelp has helped me find some real gems. i have had emery's on my radar for a bit... but the reviews on yelp seems to be a bit all over the place, with almost every review being either 5 star or 1 star. so i refrained from visiting until this past weekend. my husband wanted to take me to a new place, and he loves italian food, so we went to emery's saturday evening for dinner.

we started out with iced teas and an order of the bruchetta. i noticed there was a birthday party in the next room, and i hope that it would not impact the service we received. thankfully it did not, our drinks were never empty and our appetizer came out quickly. 

for dinner, my husband had linguine with marinara sauce and i went with one of the specials for the evening, lobster ravioli. we both got dinner salads with our meals, and my husband added on a bowl of soup. 

salads and the soup came out first, and again it was fairly quickly. the salads were basic, with a nice balsamic vinaigrette dressing. my husband was not thrilled with the pasta fagioli soup. he said it was clearly homemade, he just prefers a thicker soup. he would not pay the $5 to add on either the soup or salad again. 

we were both very pleased with our entrees. my lobster ravoli was stuffed with large chunks of lobster and the pasta was obviously freshly made that evening. my husband's linguine was also freshly made and the marinara sauce was deliciously seasoned. we finished our evening off with an order of tiramisu to go. 

i am so glad i did not let the bad reviews of emery's keep me away any longer...  we didn't experience any of the issues mentioned in the bad reviews. our server was friendly and food came out in a reasonable amount of time, considering we could both see and taste that the pasta was freshly made that night (which takes time). we will definitely be back.",4
i initially called to inquire about their services and to receive a quote about some discoloration on my leather couch. spoke to becky and said they could fix it. she mentioned fred would contact me. it's going on 2 weeks... bad business. i would have given them a try but i think ill take my business elsewhere.,1
"i went in there the other day to ask about my warranty on my phone. i woke up on saturday morning to a purple screen. absolutely no outside\/external damage to my phone and it wasn't dropped or exposed to water. the gentlemen told me that my phone was not covered under warranty and would have to pay the $150 deductible to get it fixed. so fast forward to today, i called verizon to have my number switched to an older phone of mine (so i can see what i am doing) and the guy on the phone asks how my phone is damaged. i tell him that the screen is purple but other than that, the phone is working and has no outside damage. he says 100% its covered under warranty. he puts me to the warranty folks and lo and behold, they are sending me a new phone overnight! i don't understand why the local store would put me through the ringer like that but i am so glad i called their customer supoort!!! don't go into this store!",1
"had dinner with my mom, brother-in-law and his wife at zenshin at the southpoint casino tonight. mom and i go there every time i'm in town because the food is soooo good. 

what made tonight's visit so terribly bad was the zenshin manager and his 2 hosts wouldn't allow my brother-in-law in to the restaurant with his seeing eye dog. i guess he doesn't look ""blind enough"" walking around with his new pup- who was wearing a fully labeled guide dog harness! 

the manager asked for my brother's ""blind"" credentials and after reviewing his ids insisted casino security come and verify his dog was a service dog and give her a pink tag. the manager said it was part of southpoint's new policy. what made it worse is the security guard came and kept asking ""what's the dog for? what's the service?"" to which we all had to reply ""he's blind!"" 

the cherry on top was the service was terrible and they didn't even offer to comp my brother a drink, appetizer or dessert for the inconvenience, embarrassment or harassment!! seriously?! ‍

shame on southpoint for being so ignorant of ada rights and for being blind towards a blind man! apparently, their ""new policies"" include discrimination towards the blind. 

while the food is great, that kind of ""service"" is not acceptable! mom and i will be looking for a new place for dinner from now on!",2
"i'm from canada , just passing through and in desperate need of a hair cut.i found  this salon on yelp and was totally pleased with the cut sheryl gave me. it was just like being home with my regular stylist. the atmosphere as well was relaxing and very friendly . again just like being home. if i was staying in the area i would defiantly be returning to her salon.",5
"what a wonderful dinner!! we had a number of appetizers to share amongst our table such as the sage gnocchi, fish cakes, cauliflower and pork ringlette soup, mixed olives and all so delicious! my favourate was the sage gnocchi and some of the others at the table couldn't get over the olives, fish cakes and soup so all appetizers received top marks!  for dinner we ordered pork chops and the burgers.  i have to say the food is so delicious, fresh and quality ingredients and the chef puts a twist on simple food like cabbage.  the pork chops melted like butter and the side creamed cabbage dish was the best cabbage we have ever had!  the fries with the burger were so decadent and they had a side dipping sauce made with beer that was to die for!!  portions are just right and you leave feeling like you have had a great meal at a very affordable price.  this is a local, non-franchise restaurant that has great tasting food and service.  it is something that you have to check out.  i will definetely be back and want to try everything on the menu.",5

"i gave birth to my daughter here and right from the beginning the staff were nice and friendly, my whole experience in the hospital was amazing but its when i left the hospital that made mercy gilbert stand out. i had forgotten my phone charger and some papers in the room but most importantly my daughters footprints that the nurses give you when they weigh the babies and stuff, i was crushed when i realized it being a first time mom you want to make sure you have all the little things so when i recieved a package in the mail with all of those things it made my heart melt, i have gone back to that hospital whenever i have an emergency and i recommend it to everyone!!!!",5
"this is one of my pleasant surprises of my trip to cleveland. my boyfriend and i were just walking around the city after going to the west side market trying to kill time and all of the sudden we smelled this wonderful bakery scent wafting through the streets. we literally followed our noses to farkas pastry shop because when something smells that wonderful you have to go inside. since we didn't plan to go here, we had no clue what to order or expect. we went to the counter and said what smells so great and they said everything of course. so we asked them to give us the best most traditional pastry they served which happened to be a vanilla napoleon. this dessert was so flaky, creamy, and not overly sweet. i really wish we had been more hungry because i would've loved to try some more pastries. major thumbs up to this bakery!",5
"servers are ok and they show their annoyed face when they dislike your presence. 
noodles are ok too. wonton, duck and pork bbq (asado) has the same broth, and noodles. their noodles are thin so u can taste the crunch every bite. broth is rich but with the noodles it seamed bland. for the beef, their noodles are slightly thick because the broth is also slightly thick. wonton was the least favorable. 
i like how their shrimp ball is coated with rice. thats new for me. dimsum wasn't that hot as well as the noodles. 
 note: party of 6 or more will be charged 18% more.",2
"there are lots of choices for beer afficionados...and if you are not, like me, the ""mixologist"" can put something together that you will enjoy...that is still beer, but has flavor that can fool you to drink up. they also offer wines by the half or full carafe. 

they offer food too...but since we ate before coming here, i can't remember what they serve. 

the inside has plenty of seating and lots of tvs. outside is filled with patio\/park-like tables and there are plenty of patio heaters to keep you warm. 

for those who love some outdoor games, you can play ""toss the bean bag into a little hole."" classic.",4
"shame on me for never even heard of this place until ms. tonya said something 2 months ago (and i live in the neighborhood). and shame on me twice for not trying it until today. i took my coworker here to get lunch (carry-out only). i was playing up the purpose of this place, trying to compensate for food quality in case it is not up to par. i have no worries there. the food is solid. the price is right. and it's all for a good cause.

we arrived shortly before noon. there were 2 ladies working (one cooking, the other one taking order and putting orders together). their computer system was down, which made checking out and paying a little slow. no biggie. they take credie as well as cash. 

i had the 2 piece dark meat meal (with 2 sides - fried green tomato casserole and mac & cheese). my coworker had the meatloaf (red sauce) with green beans and sweet potato casserole. my chicken was surprisingly crispy after we drove 15 minutes back to the office. i loved the fried green tomato casserole. mac & cheese was good as well. all for $5.95 (before tax) is just an added bonus.

i didn't get to taste my coworker's plate, since he destroyed it. he had been telling everyone at work about our lunch, so it must be good. he said the green beans was awesome!

they also offer sweets (by neet's sweets), and i got a big slice of red velvet cake ($3). unfortunately it got eaten before i could try a fork. i'm guessing that was good too.

definitely will be back, it's only opened during the week from 11-2 (lunch) and 4-7 (dinner).",5
"we got to vegas from mississippi and this was the first stop. what a great place! atmosphere, drinks, service, bartenders (nell is hilarious), awesome. it's a must see!",5

"we were directed to little shop of holly's by a family member after we fired our original wedding florist a month before our wedding.  that decision turned out to be the best decision we made with wedding vendors.  the floral arrangements were amazing and little shop of holly's did a fantastic job.  fantastic quality, a great artistic mind and great value for the price.  we have found a florist that we will use for everything moving forward.",5
"you can stand outside and watch them make dumplings, but you won't last long.  just look through the front window and watch the ladies make each dumpling fresh, packaging some and cooking others.  everything looks fresh, and--enough!  i can't take it anymore!  i'm going in!

this is a small establishment on spadina, suitably located in chinatown, a block from the kensington area.  you walk in the narrow passage past the kitchen at the front of the store to the seating area in the back.  the simple menu is jammed with dumpling options, i chose the pork and shrimp fried dumplings.

in no time, a big plate of 12 dumplings arrived, crisp and golden on the bottoms, and beautifully cooked on the tops.  the dumplings are fried as a group, so when they plate them, they are just flipped upside down, leaving the crisp side up.  i have had a ton of dumplings over time, but this is a cut above.  it's like the first time you have a taco in a real tortilla instead of the usual packaged wraps, the dough was so fresh...

i hoovered the dumplings down, dipping each one in a bit of the dipping sauce in the table dispensers. a dozen dumplings for $6.99.  i could have ordered more, and i should have, but i really need a reason to go back.

this is a quaint place, with the decor of a typical well-worn restaurant oozing with character.  eat in, or get 'em to go, just get some!",5
"not your typical korean bbq restaurant aka not ayce, and apparently this is the authentic kbbq experience. they have a regular menu as well. 

ordered off the bbq menu: the first kalbi option ($33) and sliced pork ($28). the kalbi isn't like the regular short ribs you get at korean restaurant. you get about 2 1\/2 slices and it was tasty though! the slice pork was slightly grilled beforehand so it doesn't take as long for you to cook it. you get about 4 large slices. they marinate it in something with lemongrass; my boyfriend and i didn't enjoy it as much. 

the service here was very slow, i think there were only 3 workers waiting. at one point we rang the service bell at least 4 times and still waited 10 minutes to get help. 

the meal came with 2 bowls of rice, 1 tofu soup, 1 large side dish of japchae (which i really liked) and a lot of smaller side dishes (zucchini, fish cakes (loved), kimchi, cucumbers, and a few others i've never had before).

overall, i don't think i'd come back due to lack of service and how pricey it was.",3
"i really don't have very high expectations for generic chain restaurants like chiles and my experience at this location reinforced my view. 

i had lousy slow service in the bar even on a weeknight when it wasn't the slightest bit busy. the restaurant area was dirty and there was a group of people smoking cigarettes outside right in front of the door.

the burgers were decent but they came out warm (not hot), and the fries were soggy (probably was sitting around for a while).",2
"the worst sushi ever! supermarket sushi would be better! don't know how people give good reviews. horrible service, awful food, rolls are huge (filled with rice). not too much selection compare to other ayce sushi. the only good thing is ice cream.first and last time eating here.",1
"i am surprised to see so many bad reviews. i've been twice and had really great chicago style pizza and a huge fresh salad each time. the chicago was really great. the crust and sauce were pretty much perfect. the complimentary bread sticks were soo good, too. my wife had fettuccine with alfredo and it was also some of the best i've ever had. plus it was only $8!

my only complaint was about the house salad. although huge and fresh, it only encompasses four ingredients. romaine, cucumbers, tomatoes, and red onions. we got the balsamic and ranch which were both freshly made and fantastic, but the salad could really use some more to it. croutons and something else like that round it out would be nice. plus the red onions were so hot and plentiful it tasted like a raw, red onion salad.

service was great and prices were very reasonable, i will continue to go again and again.",4
if i could give negative stars i would! i have a a little nail in the tire. they said a patch wouldn't fix it and a plug is too unsafe so i should buy new tires. wrong plugs were made specifically for nails! my tires are less than a year old! less than 4 months old! they just saw a women thinking i wasn't going to catch on! good thing i am smarter than your repair guys! one star because i have too!,1
"if you are a bride and groom to be, then you must admit that it's a jungle out there for wedding venues, all of them heading towards traditional virtues trying to understanding what it is the bridal party wants; then caters to their needs, be it for venue, transport, dress, food or otherwise?

the quayside is conveniently situated almost right on musselburgh beach, with a picturesque harbour opposite, small boats tied up...you get the picture, on sunny weekends or during festivals is packed with some type of private function. but with minimum competition; ok, perhaps a couple of places that might cater to similar style as this place nearby, i felt duty bound to find out if they were the best in the area, my luck was in early june.

the party i was invited to had actually won the entire wedding through a local haddington newspaper. well almost, they still have to iron out some creases, but hey when weddings cost as they certainly do, then it really pays to get this on. so thanks to the courier as the organiser!

the decor inside the quayside is dark wood, deep pile red-ish carpets, in and around the small bar downstairs, but past reception is their restaurant. another bar upstairs on first floor and another on level 2. there is a lift for people that don't fancy or can't do the walk, but it's not that quick!

with adequate parking to the rear and side of the venue overlooking the harbour, it really pays to park as close to the venue as possible, especially as it rained heavily on the day in question, so it kind of ruined those precious wedding photos!

wedding food was faultless but was it really that price(£75each according to the bride's father), but we did get champs upon reception. red and white wine with the dinner, roast chicken and haggis tower was a treat, as was choco pudding and cream (in the shape of a heart). with all that booze flowing some of our party later on just wanted a cup of tea, so when i requested this, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating, so top marks for producing a pot or two when they didn't really have to!

food booking drinks ambience were great, but you need three rules. 1. some ill placed seating meant my back was to the bridal table during speeches. to any future brides out there, save guests having a crick in the neck, check the table layout. 2. to make your perfect wedding even better, please get a band. 3. with reception closed well before 1am also make sure you prebook a taxi or this may incur a lengthy wait at the nearest taxi rank or bus stop.

speaking of food, quayside renamed their restaurant as the ""world buffet"",(does exactly as is says). the name conjures up horrors of many a fast food joint. but with many foods available (and i did ask what they didn't produce) to which the answer was - no to fruit. but i ask you, after unlimited buffet food not many peeps will have room for fruit anyhow?

requiring another visit to experience since i was there for a wedding so couldn't appreciate this mass buffet experience. my mission should i choose to accept it is to find out, but if  the wedding food was anything to go by, they'll probably be ok???

world banq, musselburgh - one place many cuisines, all for £8.50, you try you decide?",3
"i came out of my apartment only to find my car dead. i called roadside service and after an hour a tech came out gave me a jump. he recommended that i take it to a service center to get the battery checked. i went to tire kingdom and they promptly came out and checked the battery. at first, i was not sure if they knew what they were doing as they wanted to check the battery in the back. i thought they wanted to check the ""hybrid battery"" which did not make any sense to me. it turns out the the regular battery is located right next to the ""hybrid"" battery. they were very polite to me even though i did not know what i was talking about. 

they could have charged me for a new battery, that i did not need based on my ignorance. i am happy to report that they did not take advantage of me in my time of need. 

thanks again.",5
"we were so so happy with how our wedding turned out. my husband and i married here 05\/05\/17 and loved every second of it. guests are still raving about how cute the venue was and there were so many spots for adorable pictures. my bouquet was made by jenny and it was gorgeous! we booked with giddy up fixins and had a taco bar which was a huge hit. we probably are the first couple to eat at their own wedding! besides the food, tina was so helpful the day of and really knew the venue inside and out. she went above and beyond and was easy to communicate with throughout the planning process. this venue is affordable and quaint. it was a plus to us that we were able to bring our own alcohol and the bartenders were friendly. dj timmy was on point with his music and having everything go smoothly and adi's cakes\/cupcakes were delicious. 
the biggest complaint i see on these review sites is communication with venue, and while i will say sometimes i wish for quicker responses and updated open house times, i understand that there are up to 3 brides every weekend and they are priority. jenny and her staff will take care of you on the day of your wedding and at your rehearsal so you can ease your mind. i had no issues with communication the closer it got to my wedding day and that was really important to me. 
thank you jenny, tina and everyone else that assisted with our special day. it really was one to remember :)",5
"as a florida transplant, i would compare smith's to publix supermarkets. they are above average quality and maintain clean supermarkets. the staff are always pleasant and polite.

the three-star rating for this store stems mainly from the lack of selection (with certain products like yogurt) compared to the nearby smith's on sunset.",3
"tuesday lunch, excellent.  i had greek salad with soup and my husband had the sweet chili wrap with polenta fries.  both meals were very good although polenta fries may have been just a little overrated by other reviews.  would recommend this restaurant for a fantastic lunch.",5
"i think its about time i wrote a formal review for this establishment, considering i have recently bestowed it as ""my favorite restaurant"" - that's a big title to carry. 

i often judge mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and gallo blanco passes that test.  they have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.  their chunky guac is delish and summery, as they put orange slices in it. 

although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (i think it taste like cheez-its), their best appetizer is the elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it. it literally melts in your mouth! oh, and it doesn't get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to. 

the orange cake is amazing and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except, you know, orange. 

i love everything about this restaurant - salsas, food, drinks, atmosphere, prices, entertainment (on wednesday!) - they just need to get rid of that damn giant, ugly, silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar.",5

they're quick to seat you, take your order, and serve your dishes.  in that sense, service is good, where there are no delays.  if you are limited on time and want good food, this is the place to go.  one of the better places i've had dim sum and i would go back just for the food.  :)",4
my husband alan and i celebrated our 36th wedding anniversary at the all american modern sports grill last night. it was our first time there but won't be our last.  we had wonderful food and great service. i loved the moroccan salmon and my husband had a meat and cheese board as an appetizer and the blackened salmon sandwich for an entree.  everything was delicious!!,4
"contrary to my pal david my experience was better there was no hair in my food. i like the smoothies they helped me heal from wisdom tooth extraction and conveniently i could get them downstairs when i lived in that building 2 years ago. so for that i am greatfull. i think it is overpriced for eggs and toast however i don""t eat eggs as i am allergic so i can't comment on if they are great or bad. i guess the prices reflect the other hipster joints in the area your other option is greasy spoon stavros. so if hipsters and high prices are not your thing then avoid this place.",2

"wow!  we trekked to phoenix from northern arizona and on our way home today, discovered first watch.  we had a wonderful breakfast, served all day till closing. my husband and i each chose the ""trifector"" with eggs over easy and belgian waffles. the eggs were unexpectedly special: perfectly cooked and seasoned and lightly topped with fines herbs. perfect! the generous size waffles were the best we've had since the 1964 world's fair! my bacon was good but his pork sausage was outstanding.  i should note that we greatly appreciated the layout.  no crowding and plenty of room between tables to accommodate my walker.  the place was very clean and the service excellent.  we are coming back on our next trek!",5
never showed up to do the work after a consultation. we discussed trimming back 6 trees and starting service the following saturday. saturday came and went with a no show and no communication.,1

even better then i remember. very high quality fish, especially the blue fin tuna sashimi. wonderfully fresh and quite reasonable. will be back soon.",5
"excellent food, very good south and north indian dishes. 
the only bad thing is that the service is very poor. the staff is not focused and very immature else i would give a 5 star review, however the food deserves a 6 star out of 5. the waiters do not come and ask if we need anything. even the menu is not provided quickly when you are seated. you have to search for the staff and waive or literally yell at them to get their attention. 

i hope the food quality remains the same and staff quality improves.",4
"i've been here twice since they opened and i can definitely say that this is the best texmex food around the charlotte area.  the fish tacos are quite good, but any of the combinations are excellent, too.  try the jalapeno dip and fresh salsa, but don't fill up too much!
parking is a chore, but know that going in and you'll be fine.",5

horrible customer service! i was hung up on and told they would not escalate my call. our system hasn't been working properly for over 3 weeks and we are told another 5 days until some can schedule us with a provider! our electrical bill will be 3 times the amount since our solar isn't working properly and no one at sun run cares! they say at the end of our year calendar if the system doesn't produce what they say it will we will get a credit. how does that help us with our electric bill this month? the install was a horrible experience with people who didn't care and threw trash all over our yard.,1

"we had the thai chicken wraps at tropical smoothie cafe for lunch yesterday, and they were great. we ate inside, and got our meal pretty fast. when we left we saw that the drive-through line looked really, really long (at 12:15 pm). as with other tropical smoothie cafes, they need more staff-- there never seem to be enough people working, and the wait times are much slower than other restaurants like theirs. two of the guys behind us hadn't received their lunches by the time we ate and left. i think that the drive-through customers' orders monopolized the kitchen, which didn't seem fair to the guys who came into the restaurant. this one is better than the one on las vegas blvd., but they still need to have more people working.",3
"the first time i tried this place it was purely out of convenience, as it's 2 seconds' walk from my flat, but now i get takeaways from there simply because it's soooooo good!

in fact, the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because of the hour or so you usually have to wait if you order on a friday or saturday night. but that iin itself should give you an indication of how popular this place is. it's mainly a restaurant, and although i've always got my food to takeaway every time i go to collect it at least half the tables are occupied, and there's a nice buzz to the place.

i sound like a complete takeaway-food junkie... i assure you i'm not! in fact i'm really high-maintenance and fussy when it comes to getting a carry-out: i don't do it often, so when i do i like to know that it's going to be good.

their crispy seaweed starter is definitely something you should try, even if you've had it before. the portion is enormous, for one thing, and it's so crispy and fresh-tasing it's hard to believe you just served it out of a disposable tupperware box! as far as main courses go, there are way to many that i love, so i'm not going to try and pick just one to describe on here. if you still have room at the end though, you have to try their various toffee-d fruits. 

they ask that you allow 30 minutes prep time for this, which is great because a) it means that the toffee is freshly-made, and b) you have a chance to digest some of your dinner by the time it arrives!

they do á la carte, as well as pre-theatre and a special banquet, depending how much you want to spend.",4
"the deuce is a great little bar\/lounge in the middle of the casino floor.  i stopped here for a quick drink with my husband.  they have a few signature cocktails that are a bit pricey but we went ahead and gave it a shot.  we ended up both having the raspberry sorbet martini which was excellent, a good amount of alcohol and great raspberry flavor with a huge covering of fresh whipped cream on top.  it is dimly lit with comfy couches, a large table for a big party, and a few black jack tables that no one was really playing at.  the ambiance is great.  the music wasn't too loud or annoying.  i imagine we will come back here for a drink or 2 with a group of friends to hang out before moving on to see where the night takes us.",4
"i stopped by this place the other day to check out some ammunition for my dad's pistol and to check out a rifle with him. they didn't carry the brand of rifle he was looking for, but when inquiring about bullet prices, it seems they were priced on par with other places. they have a large amount of fishing and hunting gear, including many styles of bows and rifles. there are a number of camping items, as well as odds and ends that an outdoors-man (or woman) might need. you can even buy yourself an electric smoker.",3
"2 stars and a half! we ordered a nutella crepe and a berry waffle for 3. the crepe and waffle were good but i didn't like the ice cream they used. it tasted ""cheap"", almost the no name brand. but i really liked the waffle with berries. i felt that the waffle had a hint of black sesame taste and i liked that a lot. but my friends said they couldn't  taste it. so, i'm not too sure what to say about that. haha overall, it was ok.",3
"dotty's deserves all the hype that it receives. we enjoyed two of the best burgers you will ever find and equally delicious cheese curds - and this is coming from a guy who doesn't typically like curds.

the only cons i could ever offer are that the restaurant is small in size and in a prime location so the wait can be long (but worth it). also, i love darker spaces when it comes to eating but i can see some finding it too dark.

if you haven't tried this gem, please do yourself a favor and do so soon.",5
"if i could give this place 0 stars i would. the service is the absolute worst. between being seated, ordering, eating, and paying, it was a 2 hour process. the food was absolutely repulsive and made me regurgitate in my mouth. the sushi chef (some tall white guy with tattoos) was annoying and arrogant the entire time. seriously i've never been so upset with a restaurant before. why does it take 45 minutes to get your check? even when we asked for it 2 times. don't ever come here. i will hope and pray this place gets shut down.",1
"i agree with the last reviewer.  i have been coming here for decades and always felt that their gyros were the gold standard.  i went there last night with my kids and something was not the same.  the pita was perfect, the sauce was the same, but the onions and the meat seemed different.  the onions were cut very thin, paper thin--they used to be thicker.  they also had a slightly bitter taste, which i don't previously recall. the tomatoes were mealy--so much so that i had to take them off.   the meat also seemed different as well. it's hard to put my finger on it, but as i was eating it, i thought to myself ""this is what baloney would taste like if it was made with lamb...""

not the parthenon i remember.",2
my boyfriend and i both come to this salon. our hair stylist cena is absolutely amazing. she listens to exactly what you want and exceeds your expectations. my boyfriend gets a hair trim every two weeks and she always makes sure to get him in on time. i have recently just had extensions put in and a full head of highlights. she did the entire process in just under 3 hours! it came out perfect and looks completely natural. she is so helpful when it comes to styling tips and gives you fun new hairstyles to try out. i would recommend her to anyone who isn't satisfied with their current hair stylist! she has such a fun and vibrant personality which makes coming to get your hair done  a great time.,5
"had a dirty chai latte. it was expensive as heck, but it was so good i sometimes find myself craving another one. 

but i don't live in arizona, so i guess i'll have to keep dreaming.

"i had very high hopes for notorious...
my friend and i went for the first time and decided to share the capone burger, and at the recommendation of our server, the notorious fries.

everyone working here seemed almost sad. no energy at all, but still friendly...

the burger came out on two plates, which i love when you split something! it was piled high with egg (yolk still runny, yes!), avocado, onion strings, cheese..it was huge! so glad we decided to share. the burgers also come with a side of slaw, it has almost an asian type flavor, not my favorite, but ok.
the burger was great! the flavors were good and the bun held up to all of the generous toppings.

the side dishes is where notorious goes wrong. the notorious fries were really bad. i love chickpeas so this seemed right up my alley, but they tasted like a mix of tofu and styrofoam. absolutely no flavor at all. the dipping sauce that comes with them is the only saving grace. we ended up sending them back and asking for onion rings instead.

the onion rigs are huge! they arrive pipping hot and each has a thick, still crunchy onion inside, but the batter was again very bland. it's almost as if they just forgot to use seasoning on any of the side dishes on our visit.

all-in-all, great burgers, but don't waste you $$ on the sides...get a cocktail instead. :)",3
"this was my first time at jack in the box. the restaurant was okay, but nothing to write home about. the food was also just average. it wasn't bad, it didn't blow me away, it was just what i expected of an average burger and fries. i guess what i'm saying is that if you want a place to get some food, this place is alright.

if there's something i could pick at it's that it took about 10 minutes for me to get my food. all i ordered was a burger with cheese and a fry. i'm not sure if this is usual, but if it isn't, then it was slow. i didn't take off any stars for this, but it's something to keep in mind.",3
"i'm a huge cirque fan and love elvis, and may have been spoiled by seeing ""o"" as my first show 10 years ago. i've see three other shows by them, and found this one to be rather blah. 
my friend bought balcony tickets, but when we got there we were asked if we wanted to sit in the front row. we thought this rather odd, but i can see why. for this being a holiday weekend, the show was not sold out at all. all the side rows were pretty empty so they were trying to fill. this was more like a tribute show and nothing fancy.",2
"i stayed at this hotel was at a conference in pittsburgh. the location was perfect for my walk to the conference. the hotel lobby was beautiful and i love the vintage aspects of it.

i had breakfast room service each day and my order was always correct!
my room was large, clean, and had all the amenities i needed.",4
"i went here with a birthday group this past weekend. they had a big room in the back, but for the most part this place seemed a little cramped for the crowd of more than 20. i'm not sure what the rest of the restaurant looked like.

inside the place seems fairly decent, but nothing really memorable. given that it was an italian restaurant it was amusing to hear what sounded like cuban radio playing throughout the dining area.

the service was pretty slow. i'll concede that it was a large group and that can cause delays, but we waited more than 30 minutes for drink orders, and probably 45mins for bread to end up on the table (worth noting is that the bread basket came with a variety of rolls and breads which was great)

now for the food. mine was fantastic. a mushroom truffle ravioli in what seemed like a truffle flavoured oil sauce (this was great with the left over bread). for some reason this was listed online, but not on their menu, again a hint at a lack of organization.

my wife had the pork tenderloin, which she finished but repeatedly commented that my meal was much better. i'm not too sure if that means the overall menu is ""hit and miss"".

now for those menus... i get it, its an italian restaurant. but why does that mean the menu headings and dish titles need to be in italian? if they were looking to recreate the confusion of being an english speaking tourist vacationing in florence with no idea how to distinguish an appetizer from an entree then noce has succeeded. 

why do restaurants do this? i wouldn't be surprised if shell get's it's oil from the middle east, that doesn't mean the gas pumps are labeled in farsi! this drivers me crazy.

another note, the wine list is extensive, but it gets pricey very very quickly.

overall, the truffle ravioli is great. i'd say at $24 it's worth the visit, but i'm not sure much more about would make me go back.",3
"not the best (congee queen\/wong are prob better) but the decent food, prices, service, and opening 24 makes it my go to place for takeout and late night eats.

i often get the squid tentacles. sometimes it's a bit too well done and makes it a bit too chewy, but still decent.

the satay beef stomach had no satay flavor, and it was chewy. wasn't very good. the curry baby octopus had good curry taste and the octopus had good texture. the ha gao was also very good.

quality: 6\/10. service: 7\/10. value: 7\/10. overall: 6.5\/10 (not an average)",3

"i had a reservation booked for quite some time in advance for augsust 9, 2015 at copa cabana (yonge and eglington location) to celebrate my boyfriends 24th birthday. since the phone call i recieved to confirm my reservation, everything went downhill, fast. the first thing the hostess told me via phone was that there is a two hour seating limit so i have to be out in two hours. i felt like she was kicking me out before i even got there. her tone was very rude and she knew this dining experience was for a birthday. anyway, it gets worse then that. 

second of all- maybe its not protocol, however i do believe that when i phoned to make the reservation  it would have been common courtesy to inform me that there would be a live band. maybe with the phrase of ""we have a live band playing on that night, is this ok?"" the only reason i say that is because they play so loud i couldn't hear myself speak when i was telling the hostess i had a reservation. i was literally yelling because there was so much noise created by the resturaunts live entertainment. let me also add that we are not elderly people who are sensititive to noise- we are in our mid twenties. i found the music extremely loud and distasteful, but was willing to accept it as this reservation was for my boyfriends birthday and all he spoke about all week was how excited he was for the amazing food. 

we got sat at a tiny little table in a corner with barely any room. i really don't see why anyone would ever want to sit there, let alone sitting us there when we actually booked a reservation. i asked to be moved and the only place the hostess would sit us was at a table right beside the live band after i expressed that the volume physically hurt my ears and vocal cords. 

i went back up to the hostess stand to ask if the location on adelaine could possibly squeeze us in, at 8 on a sunday. the hostess bluntly said in a very non sympathetic voice ""sorry. they have no room til 9:30."" she also then proceeded to say how we are the only ones who were complaining, and nobody else has an issue. 

as a server myself, and as someone who has worked in the customer service industry for five years, i know good and bad customer service, and that was terrible customer service. you should never compare customers like that, making it seen like we are the problem. we were not the problem, the hostesses poor customer service and problem solving skills were. at $40-45 a person, you really would expect excellent customer service, which is far from what we got. 

i was ready to give my business elsewhere, when my boyfriend urged me to try and call the other location myself, so i did. i explained the situation to an employee, who said she understood and told us to come through right away. i really couldn't understand why the hostess from yonge and eglington didn't explain the contextual factors in our situation when she phoned, as she just explained it to them as we were just two random people that wanted to eat there, not really stressing the fact that we had a reservation and it was a birthday.

the few employees at the adelaine location that we spoke to including the one on the phone, our server and the manager were extremely sympathetic, and tried really hard to make us feel welcome. the staff at the eglington location and adelaine are like night and day. its shocking really. 

my boyfriend used to tell everyone how amazing the food and service was at both locations, and we were dissapointed beyond words. i have never experienced such poor service in my life",1

"bought 3 dahlias, a purple salvia, 2 geraniums, a jalapeño and cayenne chilli plant, 3 succulents and a teacup taro back in may for a balcony potted garden. the dahlias had gorgeous blooms but didn't last very long. the blooms that came up after the purchase were much smaller but still beautiful, maybe we should have spent more time fertilizing. the geraniums were resilient but the ivy one didn't ever fully bloom after re-potting. the teacup taro recently succumbed to a horrible spider mite infestation and after trimming off the infested leaves we're waiting to see if it'll continue to grow. the best purchases were the pepper plants and the succulents. we've had upward of 10 cayenne chillies from just one plant and maybe 5 jalapeños, the jalapeños were not like the ones you'd buy from a grocery store though. they were think fleshed and never fully plumped or became spicy. the succulents are wonderful and we are hoping to winter them in our apartment for next year. i would recommend sheridan nurseries but be weary of pests like spider mites.",4
"it was just the two of us for dinner, my husband and i and we ordered the tasting menu.  we chose the angus beef menu which is 3 courses: salad, protein with sides and dessert.  for $125 per person it was a lot of food and very reasonable; there was enough for four people!

here's how i'm rating the place:
service: 5 stars...the entire wait staff tending to us was professional and knew the menu inside and out.

food: 5 stars...steaks (filet and ribeye) were cooked to perfection.  you're served four salads: warm frisée, mozzarella with tomato, cucumber and shrimp cocktails.  seriously the best mozzarella salad i've had so far and i devoured the frisée.  we had four desserts...the monkey bread was amazing.  i highly recommend it.

cocktails: 5 stars...my husband is picky about his manhattan cocktails.  they got it just right including the orange twist, and the cucumber gin cocktail i ordered was great.

atmosphere: love that it's casual dining...no need to dress up.

overall i recommend this place.  yes, this is vegas and there are other steakhouses but if you're feeling overwhelmed by your dining choices consider this place.

our bill came out to $300 before tip. $13 each for cocktails, $5 each for coffee.

btw, they have wagyu on the menu as well.  i'm not made out of money but i thought the prices were cheap for this type of protein.  less than $110 for 10 oz of american wagyu and $225 starting for 10 oz of japanese wagyu.  we live in silicon valley and for good wagyu it's close to $200 for 3 oz.",5
"tracy's was amazing! i'm never going to the insurance recommended shop ever again, just tracy's. they worked with me to get the deductible out of pocket into my price range, and at the same time managed to get me a great price on clear coating the rest of the paint on my car. i got in an accident, and tracy's managed to repair my car to a point where it looks better than the day i bought it. thanks chip and aaron for working hard in getting my baby baby back to pristine condition!!",5

"we had a frustrating and disappointing experience at roland's, a dining out experience on a recent 4-day visit to pittsburgh.

first, all of the food was extremely overpriced. the quality was what you would find if you were ordering from a bar...but it was twice as expensive. the $16 i paid for fried cod got me two soggy cod filets, steamed bland vegetables and boring roasted potatoes. i couldn't have tried to make food this poor. it was a sysco food operation gone wrong: runoff from houlihan's mixed with joe's crab shack. 

the service was so slow that we were cancelling orders due to the delay in bringing them to the table. my dish arrived without any sort of sauce, and we even had to get up and order beer from the bar because our waitress was so behind. it was her ""second day on the job,"" but this is unacceptable. they could have at least comp'd our beers, or offered some other way to make it up (besides coming over to informing us that they had charged the beers to our bill).

roland's had space available on a monday night, unlike the other restaurants in the neighborhood. this was really convenient initially, but i now have an idea of why this was the case.",1

"i was rushed the first time i purchased shutters because i had out of town guest coming to see my new home and i needed to get coverings asap!  i did not shop around, a big mistake....but i decided to try sunburst shutters for my curved kitchen window.  i new immediately seeing the sample that the quality and finish was superior to what i hastily purchased prior.  fortunately the trimmed matched because they copied sunburst shutters molding trim.  but, they did not have the quality, finish and professional installation.  i even had the sunburst installers to cover up the nail heads in the molding trim on a bedroom window where they didn't finish the job!  what was nice was the attitude and willingness to oblige my request on someone's else's sloppy work!  there is no need to shop around when it comes to sunburst shutters, their service and shutters can not be matched!  they are the best!  so, my advice is don't be in a hurry when it comes to shutters, and use the first one knocking on your door, take the advice from people who know the difference, get sunburst!",5

"in the dessert of las vegas we felt famished for healthy food. we've watched enough food documentaries on netflix to scare the s- out of us making it hard to stomach sugar, salt, gmos, and a everything else that is said to give us cancer. it just doesn't taste right anymore. what can i say? fear does something to your taste buds.

so out of desperation we paid over $10 for a cab to take us three miles to skinnyfats. and the cab driver questioned us. he pulled up to a nondescript strip on the side of the highway. it looked like a row of offices - maybe even call centers. he was like, ""are you sure this is it?"" he even went in with us and took a menu to make sure it was a legit restaurant! on our second trip (because we sure went back) the cab driver gave us his cell number so that we could have a ride back. no taxis were going by that joint. skinnyfats was for locals with cars and not tourists like us.

both times we went we got freshly pressed juice in reusable cups. yum. it was like home and we loved it after the sodium-saturated, msg ridden stuff we'd been suckered into eating with our friends.

the food was scrumptious. the menu is divided into two sections. first, the skinny. that's all about healthy food. the other part is the fat which isn't quite as healthy. so, you can have chicken and waffles with a grilled chicken breast or chicken and waffles with fried chicken. get it? brilliant.

heck! we loved skinnyfats so much that plan to incorporate it into our next trip. we're going to the grand canyon and have to fly into vegas. we were thrilled to realize that we could go to skinnyfats before our three hour drive to the canyon and then again when we come back! i'll cheers to that!",5
"i am pretty sure this review is for bier markt, but if i'm being honest, i don't really know the difference between this and bar cento. i know i've been in both bars and have ordered drinks and food in both and have had equally good experiences. i have yet to check out the speakeasy. 

this is definitely one of the more beautiful bars in ohio city. the front of the restaurant has some really sexy seating - private booths with dim lighting with swaths of fabric hanging overhead. nice!

adding to the ambiance is the most amazing music selection that i've ever heard in a bar. of course, i'm biased because their playlist seems to be pretty much a cross section of my own ipod: the smiths, the shins, the cure, new order.. it just adds to the dark, sexy vibe here.

i really enjoy lindeman's framboise and they have it on tap!

the food is delicious, and the happy hour prices can't be beat! the frites are amazing, of course, and the sunnyside pizza was what started my love affair with eggs cracked over pizza. yum!!

overall, this is such a great place... i only wish there was a bigger \/ better patio, but most of the time, i don't really want to go outside even on nice nights because the interior is so special.",5
"i really love tivoli village for a few reasons.
1. underground parking with multiple elevators to get right where you want.
2. saturday farmers market with a few things i can't get in any store so i start my weekend early and pleasantly and then can run the rest of my errands the balance of the day.
3. live music during farmers market
4. really pleasant evening to have dinner (i recommend echo & rig) and then walk to the cigar lounge and enjoy live music and a drink and\/or cigar (indoor and outdoor seating)
5. if you have kids... there's  a playground with some really fun looking things.

overall, tivoli village is fairly small in terms of shopping but it's pleasant to walk around and although i haven't been to any events i'm sure they are going to have them.  it's pretty and has space for music, etc.

it's just a nice place to stop and shop and dine.",4
"affordable prices, liked the options of all the sizes. only complaint is they put too much flavor on the popcorn. it all tasted kind of buttery i suppose. big difference from air popped. i found myself only being able to eat small portions at a time due to the overpowering tastes.",4
"die piraten
eine mitmach-ausstellung für kinder
kann noch bis zum 13. april 2009 besucht werden und lohnt sich absolut. groß und klein kann sich für 0 euro piratenklamotten ausleihen (muss nicht) und dann geht es los.
ein halbes schiff lädt zum erkunden ein, mit groooßen kanonen wird auf eine arme kleine truhe geschossen, auf einem schiffsdeck wird das steuerrad gedreht und je nach richtung taucht vor einem eine insel auf oder man sieht nur blaues meeeeer, nach edelsteinen wird gesucht, diebesbeute muss verladen werden, wo gehen die piraten an deck eigentlich ihr geschäftchen machen, segel hissen für anfänger uns so weiter und so fort. eine tolle ausstellung, etwas merchandising und zufriedene kinder. super.


 einzig und allein könnte es sein, dass sich die ganz kleinen (bis 3 jahre) etwas fürchten. es ist recht dunkel und eine stimme im hintergrund erzählt wilde piratengeschichten.",5
"catania and son plumbing did an awesome job!  initially, i spoke with helen on the phone-she was extremely helpful.  prior to catania and son,  i had 2 different plumbers out to fix my outdoor pipe -after each repair it began to leak again.  catania and son came out, on-time, extremely efficient and knowledgeable and replaced the entire unit-no more leak.  i would highly recommend them.",5
"i was not a fan of this location at first. they have seriously improved over the years. their customer service has become exceptional and their selection of items have become better. great job ladies, keep up the good work!",5
this place gets zero stars! it's 8:30pm on a sunday. how the hell do a chicken place run out of chicken??? the first time hearing this!,1
this is a beautiful hotel. the line for the buffet was ridiculously long. we went to the café and waited for ever for our breakfast orders. it was delicious but i am not sure it was worth the long wait.,4
love the call ahead service. called in a hour ahead of time and then walked right in. great service and the food is always amazing! i always get the prime rib but i had the filet last night and it was perfect!,5
"you can always find something for your inner hipster here. 

i have a hate\/love\/hate relationship with this chain of stores. 

they have very cute stuff, they know how to choose what is trendy - but at the same time - they aren't very original and a lot of the same items can be found at other stores or online, amazon.com etc for less.

they are known for hijacking designs by individual artists without paying for them - so that's kind've a turn off.",3
"zero stars!! my daughter just moved in recently. apartment was filthy on the day of the move! there are cockroaches. never seen such a careless and incompetent staff from regional manager lisa - who also has a major attitude and appalling unprofessional behavior, to property manager robert. shower didn't work on the first day, had to call to get fixed. called lisa on sunday because of the shower emergency and she basically said, don't call me on sundays, put a work order in, which my daughter had already done, it's not my fault and is my day off!! laughable behavior. basically they don't inspect nor clean apartments before move-in. be ready to pay fees after fees when filling out their lease application. very little information is given prior to move in date. this is not student housing. my daughter had no idea about her future roommate. until we had to call and ask. now we know why, girl is not a student, has shady lifestyle and smokes in the apartment! i am worried about my daughter living there, read all the bad reviews about the  building safety, conditions of laundry, gym. there is no pool, is under construction, deceiving information at first visit...regret having signed lease but thankfully it is only until july! parents -run from this place!",1
"i'm sorry souplantation, but i have a new favorite salad bar. small portions of everything from burgers to sandwiches that can be accompanied by an endless salad bar for only $2 more? you can't go wrong! everything was fresh, delicious and totally the right price. can one please open by my house?",5
"the food is great, as all panara breads are. however, the staff is awful. i ordered food togo that was paid for and never received. i called when i got home to tell them the mistake and that i wanted a refund and they didn't offer anything except to drive back and get it. they were so rude and didn't care about their mistake. i will not be coming back.",1
"this was my first time at the wynn or encore. the encore is a higher class version of wynn. we stayed in the resort king suite and was thoroughly impressed. huge room, living room and generous bathroom. it was hot here, and even at 3 am, the temp only got down to 87. but the room stayed fairly cool.
overall, i would highly recommend the encore.",5
"this is my new favorite place to eat in the area. the family that own\/operates is always friendly and goes out of the way to say hello and ask about the beer selection and menu. the sandwiches are great, the pizza is phenomenal. the atmosphere is also amazing, everything is brand new and very original.",5
"whats not to love; the homemade bread, the whipped garlic butter, the generous servings, and the prompt and friendly service! this place has been serving great italian food for the last 18 years now, so that speaks for itself; however the standard of quality has not deviated despite the passing of time. just remember to bring your appetite when you go!",5
"probably the best thai food in arizona! we use to come here all the time when we lived closer, but the food is so incredible we still make the trip from gilbert! spring rolls are to die for and so is the panang! i hate to sound like a tourist because that's all anyone ever orders but the pad thai is the best around!!!!",5
"best thai food in the valley! chao, formerly latitude 8 moved locations and i just found their new place. i had the yellow curry tonight, creamy yet mildly spicey. delicious! pad thai is also amazing. my 6 yr old had the chicken satay with peanut dipping sauce and loved it!",5
"my daughter's band from boulder, co was playing a gig later that night at the traverse. the lensless glasses are a gag the band does for buddy holly's ""oh boy"", and she just left them on as a hoot. after their sound check, we had a fun afternoon at the beer kitchen next door, and then had another  great time at kama sutra. service was friendly and prompt, and food was delicious. the ambiance was okay, not exceptional. i would give it 4.5 stars, just to leave a little gap under mother india of glasgow.",4
"while i was out and about one day i stopped in here to get my toenails tended to. my toenails griw faster than lightening speed and my workout shoes become painful if  not cut short.

the place is clean, a major plus in my book.  may did my pedicure and she was very thorough.  no complaints.

i'll be back fo sho!",4
"garbage of a place frank galtieri should be fired, didn't sell a single car for the 4 hours i was there and we walked away as well rates to high even for solid credit and worst part is they act like they didn't need the sale for memorial day never going back

update came back to check out an impreza they wanted 30k for it which is ridiculous to begin with. advise them we can do 24k due to market rate and research sales dude laughed acting like he didn't need the sale. lol okay whatever man. before we were leaving he went to frank about the offer and said ""get them the fuck out of here"" we have the snapchat video of the recording too which is even funnier because the news station and everyone else on here will see that. i will never go back for a vehicle here ever again. you want a decent deal go see certified benz and beemer they have quite a view vehicles as well as subaru's and don't screw you. 

lol good luck to you camelback subaru you guys are going out of business and i can't wait",1
"new to the area and found alligator soup online for wedding invitations for my daughter.  from the very beginning, four months ago, the ladies at this shop worked very hard to make our experience simple, pleasant and fun with the utmost courtesy and professionalism.  the owner and her staff truly care about you and your event and do their very best to insure everything is done precisely as you order, making great suggestions along the way regarding things we never even thought about. my invitations were perfect and absolutely gorgeous thanks to all their help and were completed way earlier than expected.  i had to return several times for additional addressed envelopes which they will also do for your invitations and was greeted each time with the same courtesy and politeness we experienced throughout the entire process. this is an amazing shop with a gracious, dedicated, lovely owner and group of ladies behind the scenes committed to producing high quality work and they succeeded at every turn. not only would i recommend alligator soup to anyone needing the very best job on their invitations but on my last visit there to pick up my table place cards, i left feeling a little sad that it was over because i had made a whole new group of lady friends i might not see again. i will go back and show them wedding pictures, for sure.",5
"connected to the nascar hall of fame. this is a chain restaurant, with a bar and several tvs. the food is less than fair and at this particular one, the service was poor. restaurants need to stop thinking that memorizing orders is impressive or efficient. with human error being high, orders will be wrong, as mine was not correct at all. i was not about wait any longer to have them bring the correct order. for a rather large restaurant, surprised to see they were using the nascar hall of fame restrooms as their own, rather than having separate ones. tables not clean and we were rarely visited by our waitress, during a slow period. i realize that their attire is based on football, but when connected to a nascar place, maybe on race days, they should be wearing race car team shirts at this particular one. charlotte has many great restaurants, so i suggest to go elsewhere, until they can get their act together at this one.",1
"best gym i have ever been a member. sure the sports club la at the four seasons in miami was trendy and chic with their ambient light and house music but metro has something that not many other gyms have, a real knowledge of what physical fitness actually means. the crossfit classes are insane and will redefine what you ever believed a workout was. the best part about this gym is the sense of family, everybody suffers together, we cheer each other on, and we reach levels of athleticism that we did not think were possible before. if you want your gym experience to be some meaningless chore somewhere else than have fun with that, if you want to beat all your friends at every sport imaginable  then join metro",5
"very good food... nice chicken and awasome banana pudding.

good ambiance also . just missed the spicy sauces",5
"i found this place on yelp while in charlotte on business, dining alone. the reviews were great so i gave it a shot! got there just after opening, good thing because soon it was filled up. i overheard the host tell other patrons that on sat nights they usually have a line out the door but friday's aren't too bad. i sat at the bar that faces the cold prep area - the chef and waiters are super friendly and help you make decisions :). i hadn't eaten all day- had no trouble eating 3 plates - dessert after left me totally stuffed though! the food was wonderful, started with the citrus pear salad - lovely and not for sharing in my book! i had the korean beef next because it was so raved about. not totally my taste but i can see why people like it. so if you love korean food you will love it and that plate is good for sharing. next i ordered the gnocchi with roast duck, omg loved it. sublime. definitely good for sharing as it is a rich dish, unless you have a big appetite that night like i did ha! couldn't pass up dessert and coffee to wind down the meal. had the cinnamon roll with homemade ice cream but almost ordered the brownie with brown butter vanilla. the chef must have heard me debating and gave me a scoop of the vanilla. loved it more and would have that next time!  so yeah i ate for two and enjoyed the whole meal. will definitely go back - a great date night or meet up with friends kind of place. didn't feel awkward eating there alone though!",4
"came for lunch on a sunday with my 15 year old son.  inviting very comfortable atmosphere with a wonderful barbeque smell.
lets all support places like this.  very reasonable prices, big portions and smiling staff.

"i've had several chips on my front windshield for months now (maybe over a year) and the last time i tried called my insurance (progressive) they sent their ""recommended"" vendor (let's call them ""sucklife auto"") to my work. the guy came in, smelled, and was not in a uniform. even though i requested that my windshield be replaced, the tech ""told"" me it wasn't bad enough to be replaced. i told him to leave, as a ""fill"" was not what i wanted. 

after months of sunlight sparkling off the cracks and into my eyes, i called progressive back yesterday and told them the cracks were getting bigger, that i have insurance for a reason, and that i want it replaced. they once again said they would call sucklife and i said ""no, that's ok. i'll find my own place.""

yelp was my next stop. i did a search for auto glass repair and blue chip came up with 5-star reviews. i read through them and was convinced they were the company for me. i called and spoke with niki, who took my information and said she would call me back with progressive on the line. within 5 minutes i was on the phone with her and progressive, everything was verified, and i was all set. my appointment was for wednesday, between 9a-11a.

today i received a call around 9:20am saying the tech was on his way, and should arrive around  9:45am. right on time, freddy walked in my office. in a uniform and very friendly (and didn't smell)! :) we walked out to my car, he said he would be done in about an hour. forty-five minutes later he comes back in, said ""i'm done"", gave me some quick instructions on the ""do's and don'ts"" and was on his way.

all i can say is: thank you yelp, and thank you blue chip!

should i ever need repair\/replacement again, i'll be looking up your number! (oh, and my co-worker will be calling you to set up her repair!)

all i have to do now is sit back and wait for my $50 check! thanks guys! great business!",5
"what a fantastic place! the shell to the pasty's is so flaky and yummy, reminiscent of quiche, and the plethora of choices is to die for!",5
"this is a great place for dinner. service was decent although the waiter's personality we had left a little to be desired. prime rib stuffed mushrooms were excellent. all the steaks were cooked perfectly, sides were good, lobster bisque was one of my favorite parts of this meal. actual chunks of lobster, and it wasn't overly salty. i will definitely go back next time i'm in vegas.",5
"we usually go to a different place for pho. we were greeted right away and sat down. they are very nice there. our order was taken in a timely manner and the food came out quick, hot and fresh 2 small chicken pho. there was plenty of chicken in the phone. it was delicious. we will come back again.",5
"i've wanted to check out the red rock area for a few years and every time i suggest it to my husband on our way home, he always said we don't have time, so this time, i brought it up early on. he agreed to it and it was worth the stop. it's a 13-mile drive for us, but you can hike, bike and even horseback through the red rock area. 

it was windy so it was nice that we didn't have to hike through it. it was $7 per car and honestly, it was worth it. we would have stopped and hiked if the weather was nicer but all the more reason to come back here again.

my daughter loved the red rocks and kept saying that the red rocks are nice. it's really cool to see the layers of minerals that have built through the centuries. it's a beautiful part of vegas that many people don't take the time to appreciate. 

make the stop and enjoy the beauty of nature.",5
good place too eat..quality is always fresh. tortillas made in the kitchen..just busy sometimes..but wait is well worth it,4
"i have to say that all the stylists there are like artists, completely amazing!  i would recommend this salon to  everyone. the stylists are caring, compassionate, and professional. they are experts with color, cut, and blowdry. the salon has a warm and friendly atmosphere.",5
"waited till my 5th visit to review.  don't get all bad reviews? it's a fast food place.  as expected!  what impresses me is they are always busy and clean!  my kids love the orange chicken.  if course, they are kids.",5
whoa!  can we say gigantor!!!  the portions are massive.....my friend and i shared a salad and hamburger....that was really good and husband and her bf has the ribs and chicken wings!  first they bring out alien sized biscuits....all nice and warm with honey on top!!!!,4
"unfortunately, i have to update my review to one star. 

since our last experience, we have tried to come back to epiq on more than one occasion to no avail. they are now charging $20 on fridays and saturdays... even to women.

the last time i talked to the bouncers was the final attempt i'd ever make. it was 12:45am on a friday night and they refused to drop the cover charge. you want each one of my girlfriends (7 of us total) to pay $20 for only one hour of entertainment? i even asked them to reduce it to $10 and they said no.

so, i vowed not to ever go back and went to dollhouse instead. the lovely vip host comped us a bottle and a round of shots... so that's where my 5 stars, my girls and my money are going.",1
"i have eaten here a lot for dinner throughout the years. we were in search of a great lunch. we found it here at sushisamba. we had the perfect lunch to get us through a busy day in vegas. we had the seared wagyu small plate (always my favorite-i always order this), coconut rice, the samba strip roll and the yuzu tart cheesecake. everything was delicious and had great presentation. i loved that is was not loud and overcrowded at lunch. we had just the perfect lunch. the specialty drinks are a must. i can't remember the names, but one that had japanese whiskey in it with pineapple was absolutely delicious. i highly recommend it. the general manager, jeremy made our lunch extra special with a tasting of a new dish of cooked scallops with a pesto sauce that was dynamite and the miso marinated sea bass dish. everything was amazing and not heavy. the sea bass to our surprise was our favorite dish, but there wasn't anything we tried that wasn't delicious. it was so moist and had so much flavor. i love this menu because it is diverse and there is something for everyone's specific taste buds and you can easily share if you'd like. my husband really enjoyed the experience here. thank you to jeremy for a great experience along with the wonderful wait staff. if you want a meal that is diverse in flavor and presentation and will leave you full, but not heavy and uncomfortable-this is the perfect place. you get the full package here with great service and delicious food. well worth it.",5
"beware!  do not use modern nails & spa.   i personally saw a very aggressive side to a female employee.  she was offensive, rude and didn't hesitate to yell and threaten customers.  dosen't appear they have much of a clientele.
not suprising after what i witnessed. i would have given this spa a -0 if possible.",1
"my husband and i checked out the arrogant butcher last night.  i was not sure what to expect  but we are very glad we went.  the restaurant was busy but not slammed.  we made our reservation for 6:00 and were seated right away.  our waitress was amanda and she was out of this world!  she knew the menu (answered all our questions as we were debating on what to get\/offered suggestions). her service was spot on! 


we started off with potato fritters which were delicious.  and for our main course we had the special italian seafood stew and the bolognese off the menu.  both were outstanding!   the italian seafood stew was a tomato based broth, king crab, mussels, swordfish, halibut and a little bit of pasta.  

we did not feel it was expensive and would come back again.  this is my favorite fox restaurant.  i have dined at zinburger, olive and ivy, true foods and culinary dropout.
 
my only negative which i shared with the manager was the lack of signage.  we parked in the garage below cityscape and had to walk all around.  with the construction on jefferson it was really hard to see the ""a"".  the arrogant butcher is located on the southeast side of city scape near us airways.",4
food here is awesome. i was in town for a training event and ended up eating here all 3 days i was here. good service as well. would highly recommend them.,5
"cute little coffee shop near asu. i stopped here before a meeting on a chilly morning and they were very friendly in the am. i didn't get anything special, just a pour over coffee. they did have a bunch of danish that looked tasty, but didn't have the chance to try! but its a great place to meet someone for a hot drink or sit outside on a nice day to relax!",5
"great steak of course. the wine list was amazing, i was excited to see dave matthew's wine the dreaming tree on the list at a very great price! we had the carpaccio, caesar salad, prime ny and the bone in filet which was on special. everything was amazing and the service was spectacular!",4
"just an update to this review:  fatburger   ""never""  replied to my email i sent to them about our experience!!!   some customer service huh??????",1
"loan is pleasant to work with. she listens to your needs and make sure that everything i wanted was included. she was also the only one who responded right after i shopped for a new insurance online last night (even though it was past her regular business hours!). if you need insurance, don't forget to check out allstate and loan! her other colleagues in the office were very friendly as well.",5
"the raj in leith is a fairly decent indian restaurant, offering pretty good value for money. the restaurant is pretty, if a little dated, but it's right in the middle of leith so perfect for a late night curry.


 they have all the usual indian meals that you'd expect from jalfezis to kurmas, alongside nann and rice. there is nothing particularly remarkable about the food, just tasty honest food served quickly and without hassle. the waiting staff are pretty attentive and helpful with queries on the menu. prices are a little cheaper than in town, with specials on some nights of the week offering 1980s pricing!",4
woah that was a surprise! we walked in to a pitch black room with no service providers in sight. i was expecting a super sketchy dump of a place but was pleasantly surprised at how good the massage was. it is not the type of place that can be described as luxurious but if you need need pain relief after a weekend in stilettos this place ain't bad at all.,4
"it's lacking, but it's still a wonderful improvement to larimer. i hope that with the google apartments that the area will continue to grow. 

larimer & homewood need life. in the near future i hope to advance my interest in the area. we need more black people that are into urban design, renewal, & architectural landscape. 

when you have capital, capitalize and that's what i plan to do once i start making some money. bakery square is a good addition. there's so much more to larimer now.",5
"great breakfast.  outdoor seating in the summer is very nice. they have good pie too!  though it's a diner, the food is more than greasy spoon.",5
"if you need a quick repair on your glasses, come here! it took less than 15 minutes to get my sunglasses fixed and they fit even better than before they broke.",5
"chompie's has the best breakfast and lunch food in tempe! they also serve breakfast all day which appeals to me in multiple types of ways. the service is always so prompt and friendly, even when they are crazy busy on the weekends. i love eating here and have never been disappointed!",5
"intimate decoration with great service.
their sushi and sashimi was perfect.
they served a salad on a fish tank looking glass lol
there actually was a live fish inside. 

fun experience!",5
"terrible customer service!!!  the waitress ran my transaction through on someone else's debit card and ran the other person's transaction on my card (and the other person's transaction was about $40 more than mine).  she also gave me the other person's card (which i didn't notice until the next day when i tried to use it).  i immediately tried contacting the restaurant to rectify their mistake, but they don't answer the phone, there is only an answering machine.  i left a message, but no one bothered to call me back.  horrible, horrible, horrible customer service.  i will never go back.",1
"did the zoomline for the 1st time yesterday at 10 p.m. i was on one of the middle lines and was bummed to learn that it was slowwwwww. i was borrrrrred. my husband was on one of the outside lines and he was hauling #%%. i would have opted for an outside line if i had known. and last but def not least i was unimpressed with the staff. they wouldn't verbally communicate with you but simply pointed and grunted. and god forbid if you didn't understand what it was they were trying to say because then they yelled at you in front of everyone. i understand they are probably exhausted by 10:00 but thats not my problem. have a friggin shift change! also, it doesn't inspire confidence when a tired, grouchy abusive neanderthal is the one hooking you up to the rig.   crap experience",2
"this place is a huge rip off. you pay 20-25 bucks to get in, the main floor is shut down, the open space is sectioned and they won't let you into most sections. cheap dj, overpriced watered down drinks, super pretentious. the worst club i've been to in over 14 years in montreal. they should just shut it down.",1
"i love yogi's grill. i go there at least once a week. the place is spotless clean, and the food is much higher quality than yoshi's, tokyo express, kyoto, etc. they have a great selection of ramune, a japanese soda that i am addicted to. you also order at the counter and they bring it to you. the menu is varied from the usual, offering fresh sushi, yakatori, tempura and other items in addition to the usual bowls of teryaki. their signature is the arizona bowl which has crab and avacado... i'm yet to try this one. it's a quick lunch in biltmore and has great food in a nice clean ambiance, they so far are doing much better than the restaurant which was here before it. 

my only issue is they do not offer a spicy teriyaki sauce, you have to make your own using siracha, which is some spicy shit! by far my favorite rice bowl restaurant though.",4
its hard to find a good old fashion barber shop today. this one rocks. it is difficult to get a good flat top today.,5
"we decided we should try an all you can eat buffet and wow, what a spread. everything was delicious. especially the desserts.",4
"knowledgeable staff. friendly atmosphere. they have whatever spice\/seasoning you are looking for, high quality and the can help educate you how best to use it. great idea for unusual host\/hostess gifts!",4
"went there for lunch and was very pleasantly surprised to find that the food was incredible. you can tell it was fresh and homemade and authentic. 

i had the eggplant covered with yogurt sauce and it was amazing and the tabouli was the best i've ever had! it also came with yummy bread and the portions were big for the price. 

i would definitely eat here again!",5
"i work near this jamba juice, and love to get a smoothie on my break or to substitute for a meal occasionally.  

when i first started going here, they were great-fast, friendly, and professional.  they made suggestions and reminded me i could add free boosts to my smoothies.  i was so thrilled i even bought a reusable cup to get 10% off of all future smoothies. 

this place has gone substantially downhill in the past two months.  it seems grimey now when i go in, and really, who wants to consume something from a place that can't wipe the counters or mop the floors peridodically?

they have messed up my smoothie order the last three times.  

once, they accidentally poured my smoothie into a disposable cup, i said not to worry and i'd just take that, and they proceeded to pour in into my reusable cup...which only ended up 2\/3 full.  so...where did the other $2 worth of smoothie go?  i raised my concern, and the man who made it just shrugged.

the next time, they forgot my discount, and when i asked they just said ""oops, we'll get you next time.""  um...i bought your silly  cup, i don't think the 20 cents you're ripping me off for is really helping you much. i let it go since i was running late for work.  this smoothie also wasn't blended well and i couldn't get much of it through my straw.  i had to use a spoon on the final 1\/3 of my smoothie to get the fruit pieces and ice chunks. 

on my last visit, the moron who took my order must've been drunk, disabled, or both.  she was completely perplexed by my order, which was straight off the menu.  i had to repeat it multiple times, and then she couldn't comprehend what size i wanted.  i showed her my cup, and she still had to call a colleague order to get it entered right.  she also refused to give me my discount, saying she didn't know how.  she didn't take my cup, and i needed to remind her twice i had a resuable cup.  she then asked ""what should i do with this?"" once it was in her hand.  they then poured the wrong smoothie in my cup.  i had to wait for four other smoothies to be made before mine was finally made, and mixed with the remains of the wrong smoothie they had poured in first.  (yes, i did request they rinse the cup out, but they didn't.)

i called the store and left feedback on their survey after this last visit, yet i received no response, apology, or even a coupon for a discounted smoothie.  

love your products, jamba juice at gilbert & germain, but i can't justify spending my money somewhere that can't get simple products and basic customer relations right.",1
"i came here for something new with the wife back in may. she had never been, but i had some time ago.

she had their summer special salmon and i had their summer special steak. we both drew the same conclusions -  their chefs know how to cook meat and cook it to perfection! 

however, the rest of the meal was lackluster. the garlic bread was good for the short time it was warm. after that tasted very stale.

the veggies were honestly just plain wrong. the flavor seemed off, they were undercooked, and they just didn't do it for either of us.

the rice - well, it's hard to screw up rice. luckily that was good and the amount made up for the lack of food in our bellies from the rest of the meal.

the atmosphere was so cold that our food chilled off really quickly, which also aided in making it an unpleasant meal.

i wish i could say i'd return, but i really doubt it will happen.

edit:
after posting this review i received an email from management requesting for further feedback. i was promised a call from the regional manager and after several months i still have not gotten that call.",1
"okay, i was just there earlier...we stayed there about 3-4 hours.
i always go there when i need to sweat and relax.
this place always been good to relax and detox.
i thought i was getting cold and kind of feeling sick for couple of days..i went there and relaxed there for couple hours..when i came out..i feel great.
it's really clean  there and something you can afford, and it's worth it.
15 bucks and you can stay there long as you want..pretty nice :)",5
my girlfriend and i stopped on our anniversary for lunch\/dinner and we were so happy with everything!  we started with wings and man they were good but also not the same as a traditional wing. they were not sauced but rather naked wings with onions and a side of foccia bread. also an order of meatballs and to say they were awesome was an understatement words could not describe how good they were...they were a fine ground up meat with almost a creaminess to it...in a tomato sauce that was orgasmic...it also came with some fresh ricotta cheese and a sprig of basil and also some foccia bread...next time i'm just going to get a pot of meatballs because they are the bomb...then the main course the coal fired pizza it was so good with a fresh tomato sauce and fresh cheese...only knock on the pizza was that the crust needed dipping sauce to dip your crust into or sauce put to the full edge because it was dry once you got to the edge...over all this place was an excellent place to have dinner at and i recommend going to anthony's it is worth the money!,5
"i've stopped here several times, and i must say that the service is always the same slow 
waiting 15+ minutes for 3 tacos and a bean is absolutely ridiculous. even though it is within walking distance i may choose to use my car to drive to another  location with better service.",2
"i'm gonna give two stars. one because i have to and the other for our server (holly?) who was great. the food however had me less than impressed. i took 3 bites and have to throw this 30 dollar meal down the drain. i got the lobster surf and turf and can't even stomach it. my plate is so oily and greasy, the steak is so bloody and i asked for medium, and biting into the lobster felt like rubber. never again. who knows when the next time i'll be able to eat seafood again is, this ruined it for me :(",2
"food was good, service very nice, or waitress was attentive and on point with water refills and very friendly.  4.79 breakfast was quick and pretty nice size portion. ther only reason for the 3 stars is my husband's under cooked over medium eggs, that are a bit runny",3
i have used then for three years and found their work fine and their staff polite and even friendly. repairs are slow but you are pre-warned,3
"staff are very friendly and pleasant. doctor genuinely cared and did not rush through the appointment . great eye ware selection, a little pricy, but you get what you pay for. i highly recommend doing business with seven hills vision center. the office is clean and inviting. i have only one suggestion, and that is to repair or replace the carpet behind the front desk, this is the first thing i noticed when walking in the front door. everything else was great and state of the art equipment was maintained and in good condition.

it's great when a business gets it... customers just want to be treated with respect i know a few businesses that could learn this basic philosophy.

cheers,",5
i love the food here! i had some sort of delicious fried pancake stuffed with shredded meat & cheese. they were called pupusas. i cant wait to go back  :p i'm seriously jonesing for some more of those meat pancakes.... i need more like now!,5
"i'd probably go back for an appetizer and a beer, but that's about it.  

i've been looking forward to this restaurant opening for months - i love cool burger bars, and this seemed like it would be one.  sadly, i was disappointed in almost everything.

lots of places these days allow you to create your own burger, but they usually offer dozens of different toppings, proteins, buns, rubs, sauces, cheeses, etc., plus they have their own custom burgers to choose from as well.  this place has nothing but byo burgers on the dinner menu, which cost $10.25.  twenty additions are listed, and half of them cost an additional $1.00 each.  

the server did come right over to introduce himself, and we placed our drink orders.  then he came back to confirm my drink order (a bud light).  after that he showed up less reliably.  it took quite a long time to place our food orders, somebody else delivered our orders, and he never came back to ask how we liked the food.  we were one of his three tables at 3:30 on a saturday afternoon.

i got the breakfast burger, ""add cheddar.""  the server didn't ask how i wanted the burger done and forgot to add the cheese to my order (i wasn't charged for it, either).  it was an okay burger nonetheless, but nothing special.  it did come with a handful of fries on the side - this isn't mentioned on the menu about this burger, or about the byo burgers.

my daughter got the cream cheese stuffed french toast.  we were just totally confused by this item.  it wasn't even pretending to be stuffed - just several (six?  eight?) half slices of thin white bread french toast with a dollop of something on the edge of each slice.  the online menu says it's an herbed goat cheese.  either my daughter didn't read it correctly or the menu in the restaurant was different, because she would never have ordered that.  in any case, goat cheese is not cream cheese, so that doesn't make sense.

we also shared the southern mac 'n cheese app, which was excellent.  

the food was mediocre and expensive, and the service was terrible.  i'll give the servers a little slack because this location is so new, but there are other local locations, and management should have arranged for the servers to train there for at least a few days before starting at this location.  because they didn't do that, they've had a poor opening, when guests are deciding whether to return and whether to recommend the place to their friends.

i wanted to love this place, and will give it another try, but from what i saw tonight, they've got a lot of work to do to make this place great.  i hope they pull it off!",2
"love this hidden gem! organics...vegan and vegetarian options for food and drinks. coffee is delicious and soooo reasonably priced. i'd rather have amazing service, great coffee and cozy atmosphere for less money than wait in line at starbucks! had blackberry iced tea today was refreshing and delish as expected. give this place a try you won't regret it!",5
"new to mesa dental
had a great first time visit at mesa dental! like many, i'm not a fan of coming to the dentist, but dr. browner made the visit very comfortable. she got the job done nice and smoothly! just walking into the office you get that sense of comfort, not only with the staff, but their overall environment. i will be holding on to dr. browner as my dentist. she definitely did not disappoint.",5
"this is a rather out-of-the-way place for me, but it has been on my radar for quite sometime. finally made it out here with some friends, and olivier didn't disappoint with his sandwiches and coffee. got a large latte and the cups were huge - felt like i was bringing a mixing bowl to my face with every sip. but great coffee.

got the egg, cheese, bacon on baguette. nothing here is rocket science, but simplicity is elegance sometimes. baguette was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. ordered croissants and a parfait to go. same results - fresh, buttery, flaky croissants and organic yogurt with fresh fruit.

i wish the ordering was a little speedier but it was okay because we weren't in a rush. honestly, i'm not sure how often i'll be back here because of the location, but anytime i'm around, i'll probably stop by - maybe when ikea opens up!",4
"i disagree with the masses on st-viateur.  maybe i came in at the wrong time, but my bagel was a bit stale and not nearly as flavorful as their competitor.  

it's an old building and it's cool to see the cooking process.  they just weren't my favorite bagel in the neighborhood.",3
"i ordered the scottsdale salad, it was served with raw chicken. not only that but the waitress had a bit of attitude when we were just asking questions about the menu. small little place, good beer, but i wouldn't recommend it.",2
went on a saturday night. band was good. crowd was fun. they are mostly school kids. but bartenders need to be a bit freindlier. they all look pissed off and didn't want to be there. beer was good they can't mess that up. other mixed drinks were watery mostly soda.,3
"ok. not any better than wannaburger but considerably more expensive. not worth the extra.


 having said that, the surroundings are more agreeable here.",3
"arrived around 5 for dinner and the restaurant was entirely empty. this was nice as we had great service and the entire menu was explained to us by our waiter. he suggested the combo app platter that had tostonies, fried plantains, yucca & two dipping sauces which was a jalapeno ranch and regular ranch. this was good but did fill you up pretty quick. he recommended the dinner combo... ok portions are huge. could have skipped the app combo. dinner special was 2 empanadas of your choice. they have about 10 different varieties. also on the plate was rice, black beans and some more fried plantains. i would have opted for the dinner special. you can order the empanadas individually which run around $3 each, they also serve 4 different tortas with the same fillings they use for the tasty empanadas. place was very clean on the inside. as we where seated a couple was leaving. they decided to move outside by the main entrance and proceeded to smoke. the smell of smoke did fill up the dinning room and the owner asked the patrons nicely to move away from the door which they graciously did. the food was very good and the service was excellent. prices pretty decent as well. dinner special ran $11 and well worth every penny.",4
"from the moment i decided to take a vacation day off from work today i have been planning my schedule around stopping in here for lunch. since moving to tempe a few months ago, i am constantly on the lookout for new vegan\/vegetarian spots. however, due to their very limited hours, i have never had a chance to make a visit to desert roots kitchen until today.

i didn't immediately notice the restaurant from mill avenue because it is tucked away in a little square right behind the big store-fronts on the main sidewalk. phew! this quaint, quiet location is totally befitting of their style of restaurant. i was pleasantly surprised at how calm the environment was considering its proximity to mill avenue in the middle of a school day. the front of the store has some patio seating where customers were easily able to sit undisturbed and read or chat over their meals. 

upon entering, the staff was responsive and very positive. i told them it was my first visit and they explained the menu and encouraged me to sample the food before ordering anything. ...don't mind if i do!! 

everything i tasted was delicious, fresh, and made from scratch that same day. i ended up getting the fresh veggie & kale wrap with lentils and their garden herb spread. it came with a side of fruit, and the size of the wrap was very generous... i'm saving half of it for lunch tomorrow.

it was delicious. the flavors came together very well, and just thinking about those ingredients gives me a nice healthy feeling... a feeling that you don't frequently have after dining on the normal ice cream\/burger\/pizza fare served up at almost every other one of the restaurants on mill. i'm incredibly happy with this new health-conscious, vegetarian-friendly addition to a shopping district that was in such desperate need of it.

now go check it out!!",5
i'm very annoyed sitting outside of this walgreens right now.  i needed something super last minute so i checked the hours online and it says they're open until midnight.  low and behold i drive over here and they closed at 10.  fix it.,1
"haley! thank you so much for all of your help! your above and beyond work ethic and customer service\/satisfaction exceeded my expectations and experience. you truly are a great asset to the bab brand and any employer would be lucky to have you manage their brand\/company!! 
5 stars is for haley and the experience she provided!

it was a special occasion that seemed to me like a difficult situation with a 3 year old. haley handled it like a champ and i'm just in awe of her. 

thanks again so much! i hope corporate reads this and acknowledges you in the future you have at bab! 

best regards from candice!!",5
"this is a great little bar \/ restaurant.  there is a divider that runs between the horseshoe bar and the double row of tables and booths.  but you can step through the divider, so we are all one big happy family.  although i've never sat at the bar, there is always a crowd of seemingly happy people laughing and joking.  not a drown your sorrows kind of place, more a ""cheers"" kind of place.

the food here is very good, very freshly prepared and portions are generous.  we've been coming here for 30 years - lighthouse, (something else for a while), hurricane alley and now the bistro.

we started with bbq pork cups - a very filling appetizer that could easily be an entrée.  also, fried pickles with chipotle sauce, both great tasting.

hubs had the meatloaf and declared it very good.  son had the philly cheesesteak and fries.  too much for him to finish, so half went home.  note:  their french fries are better than the potato patch, no lie.  i had the salmon salad and although i didn't care for the balsamic, it was on the side - salad was fresh and the salmon was perfect.

it's a pretty great food stop, and no longer a dive bar with their recent upgrades.  and the service is always friendly!",4
hands down the best breakfast place i've ever eaten at plus great coffee and add-ins as well as a pot of french press! their steak is cooked perfectly and the bread in a cup is to die for or so i've told.,5
"i have nothing but good things to say about the staff at pure plumbing. the first time they came over we had problems with kitchen sink and they sent mr. parker who was very professional, personable and knowledgeable with his job. the second time we needed a plumber was when my toddler flushed a potty training seat hook and it made water flow sluggishly in the toilet. this time, the company sent daniel. he was also very professional, personable, and knowledgeable. they are honest and they get the job done. i'm not really one to write reviews anymore- especially if it's not about food but daniel really saved the day with fishing out that potty training seat hook that i felt the least i could is contribute to their growing success. from the one who answers the calls and how they say, ""it's a great day at pure plumbing"" to the thank you card and gift they send you after they've worked with you, pure plumbing is a pleasant resolve to your plumbing worries.",5

"this was my first time taking a dog to an off-leash dog park and bree (the pupper) absolutely loved it! the only problem we had was finding this place as the location was a bit off from the actual location. thanks to a fellow yelper who guided us! it's on miller ave, west of roddick. 

once we got there, we let bree off her leash and she ran like no tomorrow. she was happy to see all the other dogs and more importantly all the other people! 

one tip i can give to you is that if your dog is aggressive, keep on eye on it in case problems start arising. we had to separate bree a couple times with a couple big dogs because he wanted to (play ) but thankfully his owner knew what was going on and gave bree some space. 

we'll definitely be back here! it's also super cool to be surrounded by all different kinds of puppers and be able to play with and pet them!",5
"just another bubble tea place in pmall. everything looked pretty expensive - i think the large sizes after tax are $6.25. there were a few drinks on promo where you get 2 large for $10 before tax. one of these drinks was the 'panda milk tea"", which on the picture, looks like regular milk tea + black and white tapioca balls. when the drink was handed to me, all the tapioca looked clear and the milk tea tasted normal. it didn't look nearly as cool as the picture. 

there's nothing else special about their drinks - i'd go elsewhere in pmall and opt for a cheaper option.",2

overpriced, psuedo urban hoity toity experience.

"the owner of elite is steve, a fine young

must try little gem in the south hills of pittsburgh! ribs are awesome... if you get wings try the mustard sauce.,5
this place has great value and great food.  can't complain!   the homefries are amazing and a must try!!,5
ok i've been to goyeman several times. the one thing i hate about this place is the wait! you will have to wait if you have a bigger party than 4. they do take your number and text you when your table is ready. the food- phenomenal! you have to do all you can eat. very reasonably priced $26.95 for dinner and you can get appetizers to dessert and everything in the middle. i love the fried shumai ! service is quick once you are seated!,4
"we love living down the street, from what we deem, the best little donut shop in the greater phx area. this shop has character, charm and best of all great donuts. hoping to see more small business\/local cafes, stores and restaurants enter into s. scottsdale like born and glazed.",5
"like a cliffhanger that leaves you panting for more, house of gourmet (someone might have forgotten to mention to them that their name isn't exactly grammatically complete...) made us vow to come back to try their other cheap and tasty dishes.

rundown:
- shrimp dumplings in soup: i had them withhold the noodles; just wanted a big bowl of shrimp dumplings which were amazing! perfectly done...dumplings were not soggy or too soft or mushy. huge chunks of shrimps. soup was tasty. @$3.99, this dish is unbeatable

- singapore-style pan fried turnip cake: i grew up eating this dish, so i have high expectations. they did it pretty well here...but not 100% authentic. the pieces of turnip cake were a lot bigger than what the dish normally would be (honestly, about 4-5x bigger than what it should be). 
most importantly, it's missing the crunch that usually gives this dish texture: preserved radish (chai poh). without the chai poh, the texture of this dish is pretty one-dimensional
it also doesn't have the slightly crispy glaze on the turnip cake...they should have left it a little longer in the wok
but don't get me wrong...everything else about the dish was pretty good taste-wise. 
@ $5.50, the dish is pretty good. i'm not sure i'll order it again though, unless i'm really craving s'porean food

- hk milk tea. wow. they really need to add condensed milk to this drink. it was too bitter and tasted a little medicinal?

overall, a great and affordable meal... will be back to try other dishes; the menu is extensive!",4
"i hadn't been to flatiron for a while, but we decided to eat there the other night.  the food was very good, but the service was terrible!

the details:  we had the calamari appetizer (delicious!) and a hot crab dip (mediocre).  the dip didn't come with enough chips and was dense with mostly cream cheese - very little crab and artichoke (i think that was the combo).  it took 10 minutes to get a waiter (not our own) to get us more chips, by which time the dip was cold and congealed.  other servers delivered our meals - trout, burger, chicken and waffles, salmon, herbed chicken - all were very good.  but once again, when we wanted more drinks, water refills, etc., our waiter was no where to be found.

the most frustrating part was watching the waiter hang around the bar, or on the other side of the restaurant and not even look our way.  i'm hoping he was just new and didn't know how to handle free time, but he needs to learn quickly.  i'll go back to flatiron, but would ask for another waiter if i got the same guy.",4
"absolutely horrible! do not trust them with any dental work. i got new insurance with my job and decided to give them a try. remind you i've had a lot of dental work done in the past and ever since i've taken really good care of my teeth. i went for a check up and they ended up doing x-rays that i'm only allowed once every three years without my permission, then they told me my crown needed to be replaced, i needed a few fillings refilled and i had two cavities. long story short i didn't believe them so i went to another dentist and my crown is still in decent shape and the doctor couldn't find any cavities or fillings that needed to be replaced. in fact both dentist that did my check up said how amazing my teeth we're. dont trust them.",1
"there has always been a stigma when you go to a car dealership you are going to get pressured into buying a car that doesn't fit your actual needs (i.e out of your price range, not practical, etc.).  that was not the case coming to mark mitsubishi and the reason for that was the sales person benjamin fields.  he made us feel like we brought a friend with us to buy a car, so personable and not once did we feel any pressure that we had to buy a car.  ben was so patient and friendly that it made the 8 hours we spent at the dealership looking at cars fly by.  ben's knowledge of inventory and finding personalized cars to suit the individuals needs was monumental in the deciding factor to go all in and buy a new car instead of a used model.  thanks again ben!!!! #wheresthebeef (inside joke)",5
"i think i have an emotional attachment to this place because my cousin treated us out here. it may shock you, but this was my first time experiencing the korean soju drink w\/yogurt! i'm not a drinker, but i tried it and it tasted just like those asian yogurt drinks. really good stuff! 

i especially remember the grilled corn w\/mozzarella cheese. when my cousin first ordered it, i didn't understand what was so special about it. but, this is a must try!! i also tried the rice cakes wrapped in bacon. it was different, but tasted mediocre. 

when i'm back in lv, i'll probably definitely stop by. service was decent, but its more my nostalgia that wants to bring me back.",4

"i was so looking forward to this market, but it was very disappointing when i finally went. where are their foods from south america and the middle east? i wanted to buy dulce de leche and other sweets from argentina and chocolates\/snacks from israel. i was surprised that they didn't have inca kola from peru (even ranch market sells it) or garotos from brazil. it was mostly asian and indian items, dollar store trinkets and regular supermarket groceries. they must carry food items from around the world to be truly international, if not, they should call the store an asian market. also, i was very annoyed that they have a $10 minimum for debit card purchases. their lack of international foods made it difficult to reach that threshold.",2
"i had the teriyaki chicken veggie bowl. i couldn't wait to try this place out because of all the raving reviews about how good the chicken is especially. the chicken was very tough, hard to chew on. the veggies underneath the chicken were filled with oil and  had no flavor. i was very disappointed.  i keep on trying to find one thing i was impressed by in my meal, but there is nothing.",1
"heard the ex-5 start hotel asian chef was forced to leave the restaurant ever since the end of last october, because the then-new management only wanted to serve basic food to their tourist bus clients!  my local friends living in henderson were even rejected to go in there since they were locals!  wonder why it starts open to locals and non-tourist buses.  don't even bother to go there, save your valuable time!  so disappointing that another originally nice restaurant was off the list...",1
"pretty typical for the tilted kilt. nothing special. we only came here because we are staying at the linq, and it was close by and the least crowded. it was actually pretty dead. 

we were seated right away. the host were standard. not super friendly and energetic like we prefer. they kind of just went through the motions, but at least they smiled.

our server was nice, but pretty mono tone like the host. the restaurant was pretty slow, so they were probably just bored lol. anywho, we ordered the nachos, and pre game pickles. we only got the pickles because they were free if you add your email to their email list. i'm glad we got the pickles though because they tasted pretty good. the nachos tasted like pure grease, and the meat on them was blah. for our entrees we order a half rack of ribs, kids mac n cheese & the fish n chips. i didn't see one salad option on the menu, which was disappointing. i mentioned that to my husband later, and he said he did see 1 salad, but only 1, so it was probably a plain house salad. anywho, back to the food. my husband really enjoyed his ribs. he said the sauce was great, and that the half rack was plenty. the kids mac n cheese was a great size. my fish n chips was disappointing since i was really craving a tasty flavorful batter around some fish, but the batter tasted like the nacho chips, just like grease. it didn't have any flavor, no seasoning, salt, nothing. grease.

i must say the red sangria was fantastic. i am not much of a drinker, so many times i end up leaving most of my drinks pretty full because the alcohol is just yuck to me. nope, not today. it was sooooo good. i was giving 3 stars, but decided to make it 4 only because the red sangria was great.

they have some fun games, foosball, shuffleboard, some electronic games (darts or golf i think), and our favorite corn hole!

pretty standard overall. nothing special. the long beach location is better.",4
"high quality, delicious sushi. easily among the best in town, plus an optional all you can eat menu that doesn't sacrifice quality means this place cannot be beaten, in my opinion.",5

"my 10 month old daughter found cocaine while playing in the hotel room and all they could do was offer 150 in food and drinks. it took speaking to six people for anyone to offer a paramedic. they moved out rooms and i found cocaine in the same place in the second room. cleaning staff was sent to ""clean"" it and she wiped once with a rag still leaving cocaine residue. mary little, jackie truijillo, & karen had no sympathy for our situation. mary said she couldn't help and i had no proof that it was actually cocaine. karen sounded like a broken robot repeating they couldn't do anything without filing a security report which i thought i did when they sent security to both rooms but she later told me that wasn't a report it was just a statement. and jackie was the only one who offered a paramedic for my daughter but stared at me retarded when i said i didn't feel comfortable paying all this money for this type of experience. then she sent 8 paramedics up who surrounded my baby making her uncomfortable to plug her up to vital machines. jackie stayed in the hallway and didn't even have the decency to come inside and apologize or say anything to me. i don't even feel comfortable staying in this room. do not stay here!",1

"i bought 2 brand new 16 seer air conditioners and had them installed by a professional reputable company. they check my home for leaks and completely remodeled my duct work. 
my bill with srp initially started to go down by almost $200.00. about 30 days passed and i noticed by bill starting to rise by $300.00. i called out the company for a complete inspection of my duct work and seals. all fine...
i believe srp starts to gouge when they see your bill getting lower, the higher the temp outside the higher they raise there estimated prices. the reason i say this is because i just came back from a 2 week vacation and when i left shut everything off except for the refrigerator,  to my surprise my bill dropped only $20.00. i will say this till the end.. srp scams there customers especially if you have an electronic digital meter. i have seen this year after year ever since the new digital meter was installed.",2

"the food is wonderful. fresh, well prepared, and delicious. the atmosphere is lovely and, when the weather cooperates, the deck is awesome. everyone that works there is always friendly and welcoming. this has become one of my favorite ""go to"" restaurants in shadyside. byob is another plus. hope they're around for a long time!",5
"so we walk into the this place on a friday night around 8 pm. the reviews we had read were great and we were hungry!

the place is small and cozy, it was somewhat crowed -but not too much-, was playing loud latin music, and all the staff were either from mexico or el salvador. not only that, but everyone was super friendly as well.

we ordered guacamole and tacos and had really high expectations. we enjoyed the guacamole but the tacos were just plain blah... we were so disappointed! the double tortilla made the tacos dry and the meat and veggies inside just didn't have any flavour.

we didn't try the pupusas but when you have ""tacos"" in your name you'd assume that's their specialty.

this place gets 2 stars for the speedy service and warm staff but unfortunately toronto just doesn't have a good place for tacos and el asador is no exception...",2
"love this location, not that i've ever experienced a bad one but these guys are super friendly and have never messed up an order yet. we love to take the puppies and sit on the patio with other friendly dog owners",5
"my husband & i went during their soft opening and we both ordered the 10oz filet mignon. it was an excellent tender cut of meat and great quality for the price. my husband asked  for a side of garlic salt to use while cooking our steak on the stone which was a good call. the bourbon glaze was outstanding. i had the vegetables and creamed corn (had a hint of pineapple) both were excellent and not the usual. my husband had the baked beans and garlic mashed potatoes and gravy both were good but usual in taste. we highly recommend this restaurant and wish them great success as we love the view of the airstrip and another restaurant choice in the red mountain area. 

recommendations: atmosphere could be cozier inside and the steak knives could be sharper. the fresh brewed ice tea was good but needed larger glasses and some sweet n low. also recommend having garlic salt and maybe some other seasonings available on the table.",5
"i have no connection to the restaurant and my review is based on honest opinion.....the food is special and way above average for a mexican restaurant..... but cannot believe anyone would think this restaurant is only average or nothing special. 
give this family owned restaurant a try....they have survived decades  in the restaurant business and definitely not a franchise typical chain,  check out their history and better yet try a meal at their great restaurant on dobson, you'll be back.",5
the fish sandwich was massive. the service was horrible and there were less than 12 people in the whole place. the food came out and was barely warm. there are only like 4 tables so good luck getting a place to sit when service takes forever.,2
"huge fan of bill's! like many others who adore the tidy little place, i've never stayed overnight here, but still find myself here each and every time i'm in vegas. i've loved the old-timey (victorian, right?) vibe here since it was barbary coast and precious little has seemed to change since the caesar's\/harrah's people took over a few years ago. big elvis (who isn't so big anymore), the cheap and tasty hot dogs (now served at the coffee shop) are still there as is the famous late night steak and eggs special. the limits are low here and this is one of the few places the craps tables seem to consistently treat me well. the drink service is stellar here while at tables or at the bar. all in all, a wonderful place to return to each time i find myself in town.",5
great place!! .. one stop shop all .. friendly worker and good job for reasonable price,5
"blech. had to work at u of phoenix stadium today and mom came down from payson to meet me for lunch after.  i don't know westgate at all except for the hockey arena.  
it's in an outdoor mall, like everything else.  we were starving and the entire mall was dead.  it looked like places were closed, so we went to margaritaville for lunch.
main entrance isn't clearly marked and we went in through the patio area.  walked in and didn't see a reception area.  so, we asked the nearest waitress if we were to seat ourselves.  she said in her best airline stewardess voice ""ovah they-ah is where you check-in.""  it was fake and annoying.  so, we go check in.  15 minute-wait for 2 people.  the place was crowded, but we had passed a few empty tables along the way.  my mom even pointed it out.  ""our kitchen is pretty backed-up, so we can't seat all tables right now.""  keep in mind this was at 12:30 on a saturday afternoon.  wouldn't this be the time to make sure you know to have enough kitchen staff on hand???
we meandered to the bar, which was empty except for 2 people.  we sat at the corner and, luckily, found out we could eat there.  the bartender was the first friendly person we came across, and i'm glad she got a tip from us.  service was quick.  our food came out within 10 minutes.  
mom got the chicken quesadilla, i got the taco salad.  i couldn't believe how few items were on the menu.  i was expecting a bit more.  
food was average.  nothing i'd ever go back for.
they kept showing videos of jimmy buffet and the people at his concert.  they were having way more fun than we were.  nobody shouted out ""where's the salt?  where's the goddamn salt?""  i would have, but my mom's been suffering from almost 40 years of embarrassment from me already.
blech.",2
"i was very impressed by the food, the ambiance, and the service!  we had a great time! totally will recommend to anyone who likes to eat:)",5
"great italian in tornoto.  portions tends to be smaller, but the food is great.  fritto misto, beef carpaccio and the olives were great.  we also enjoyed chicken, involtini pork, sexy duck and crespelle.  service was fine.",4
"came here for a quick bite. while i enjoyed my pricey turkey and chicken sausage, it was too hot (temp wise) for me to enjoy the heat from the jalepenos in it. i think if i came again i would try my sausage sliced up in the currywvrst style as opposed to the traditional bun style. also would try the duck fat fries... seems to be pretty popular.

i like the communal tables although the after-work crowd dominates this place (along with everywhere else on king west). i can see why, it's dimly lit, has beer, fries and sausage... why wouldn't they be here? i do wish the lighting was a bit better. it's nice in the bright summer hours but i wonder how dark it feels in there during the night time?

it seems like a fun, friendly place to go for a quick, no fuss bite (except the choices could be considered fuss... there's a lot of options on that tiny menu!!). also the family next to us got soft serve in a cup and it was just so cute! my date and i were pretty worn out from all our walking earlier in the day, so we just wanted to eat and leave. but for my next visit, i am definitely getting myself soft serve!",4
"wasn't expecting to be so entertained by what was essentially a crash course on whisky. first 45 minutes or so jd was telling us about the different kinds of whiskeys, fun facts, and also answered any questions we had. then the last 45-60 minutes we were doing the tastings. he had a very particular way he wanted us to drink each whiskey to maximize its flavor. 

jd was extremely knowledgable and passionate about whisky making it fun! anyone who has already taken this tour should appreciate my selection to spell whiskey differently throughout this review haha.

only change i would make is i would have liked to take home one of the taster glasses as a memento. but other than that, i have absolutely no complaints.",5
"caleb should not be working there. avoid him! when he couldn't help me with an issue, he ""dismissed me"" and walked out the door. yes, he told me that he was ""done with me and i could leave."" 
cox has fraudulently taken money from my old bank which resulted in a lot of fees. i updated my cox acct with my new bank info months ago and my online acct even shows this. autopay is the worst idea ever. never enroll! they refuse to refund those nsf fees even though it is their fault and they have no authority to withdraw from that account. what ever happened to companies trying to make things right? 
i sure hope the cox managers see this review and change how they deal with customers and also train their employees how to speak to people. caleb surely needs a new job or some training.",1
"my worst meal in vegas over 4 days.. and one of the most expensive to boot. the rissotto was undercooked and tasteless, the seafood stew had so much tomato base the flavor of any seafood was lost, and even the salads were uninspiring.",1
"just visiting the area for the football game and was craving steak for dinner. the reason for such a low rating was due to the food. we got a filet, sirloin, crab cake, calamari and caesar salad. the sides to our steaks were good, but the steaks sucked. i ordered a medium and the steak came out pretty rare and the teriyaki was not what we expected. we didn't even end up getting dessert. the 3 stars is to the wonderful service that made up for the food.",3
"i love the food, fresh and always hot. price reasonable and they have daily special price for $5. i love the service. they listen and learn for making more good service and food. will come back again and again.",4
"teriyaki time is one of those places that tries too hard to sell what they think the people will buy, therefore losing it's identity in the process. but it's still food that does the job and at cheap prices. 

it does have teriyaki, but i have this rule that i rarely eat teriyaki outside of my home as i grew up with it and have found that not many places that sell it make it ""right"" or even good. also, i think teriyaki is way overrated as a food in itself. also, they have other japanese dishes that are usually easy to find at your average ""oriental"" mom and pop places like tempura dishes, bentos and bento combos that's served with your everyday california roll and miso soup. all this stuff isn't bad for the price, but you certainly get what you pay for. 

what is surprising about this place is the korean food. there's a korean food menu that has kimchee bibimbap, the regular-ish-type of bibimbap that doesn't come in a hot, stone pot, galbi, bulgogi, and soondubu, and a few more things i'm sure i'm forgetting. considering most of my usual korean places are clear across town and\/or too far to drive to on my lunch break, this is a gem of a find. 

the first time i delved into their korean food menu, i tried the kimchee bibimbap and it was uber tasty. sizzling hot, tangy, and spicy. and it was the good kind of spicy where you had to wipe your forehead every few minutes, which tells you that the heat level is just right. the second time i got the soondubu which was also pretty good. i asked the lady to clarify if it was just the beef soondubu or if it was a mix of beef and seafood. she said it was actually seafood only, which i didn't want, and i asked if they could make it beef only. she had to ask the chef\/cook in the back if they could make it like that, and he agreed. it was pretty good considering it cost almost $2 less than the soondubu at mr. tofu, but the soondubu at mr. tofu still takes the cake. 

overall, pretty good for the korean food, but just ""meh"" for the other stuff.",3
"hired poppa naps for my backyard wedding.  he showed up early to start grilling in his huge steel smoker type bbq.  it made the whole yard smell amazing.  as we ran off to take photos he gave me the first taste of the brisket right off the grill and i almost choked...it was so juicy and delicious.  
i got the triple gut buster 3-meat option with a bunch of sides.  everyone loved it and he left us the left-overs so we were eating it happily for days.  
his prices are very reasonable and he is just a lovely person all around.  he made me feel really special and checked in on me lots of times just to make sure i was doing okay in my planning process.  
will definitely use him again anytime i want a caterer.",5
d-lish!  great veg options and such a delightful staff.  pricing on sundays are great if you are looking for a wonderful menu at a good price.,5
"pho - broth was bland, not enough noodles and meat but plenty of onions
shaking beef - bland. meat tasted like it was quick defrosted. no flavor at all.
pad thai - bland

i wish i had taken pictures but it wasn't even worth taking up space on my phone. i would like try the hotpot but idk if i can bring myself to come back here. service was poor. i think they were short staffed. 2 people out on the floor on a friday nite.",1
"this place is effing disgusting. they are now called holy chicken. they forgot half my order and the mashed and gravy are highly processed. i get to work and it looks like what you would call beef gravy and there is no beef anywhere on the menu.
the  breading on the chicken falls off and it is way too greasy and they  forgot the fries and hit sauce. they have no communication skills. the kid at the counter was trying to look busy by going to and from the kitchen but doing absolutely nothing. i had to wait over 20 mins for my order and they didn't say one thing to me about the wait time. do yourself a favor and quit the restaurant biz. you suck!! if i could give negative stars for this review i would give negative 20",1
"love coming here for breakfast whenever i'm in vegas! located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan, it's pretty easy to spot as it's the only place that ever has a longass line...! line moves decently fast though, and food comes out at a steady pace. compared to the line in la (which can take up to an hour!!!), this is wayyyy easier.

i usually go for the sausage egg and cheese sandwich, which is always on point, but sometimes their soft scrambled eggs in the fairfax sandwich really hits the spot. both are good, and if you have the appetite, try both!!! they're packed with flavor even though they're both pretty simple breakfast sandwiches.

i think the slut (basically potato puree and an egg) isn't worth it...super expensive and nothing special.",5
"my new favorite go-to restaurant for a quick healthy dinner with big enough portions to have leftovers for lunch! 
i love the ""create your own bowl"" option and the staff was super helpful at explaining the ingredients. i wasn't sure if i wanted quinoa or cumin rice as the base of my bowl and when i asked which one is better, my servers response was ""why don't i give you a scoop of both and you tell me which one is better next time you come?"" which i thought was really nice (for reference i liked the rice better)! i also got the cucumber and tomato salad and chickpeas on top with falafel, hummus and tzatziki sauce. 
my boyfriend got the rotisserie chicken plate and absolutely loved it. the mac and cheese and potatoes that he got as his sides were tasty and good complements to the chicken. 

it is a bit of a hike from the uptown area but definitely worth the drive! if you are a fan of places like viva chicken and chipotle i recommend that you try yafo as soon as possible. 

it is also a good spot for a cheap date night: get your food to go, pick up a bottle of wine from winestore. next door and bring them home enjoy while watching a movie!",5
for a gas station the outside and inside are usually pretty clean. the car wash is nice but can miss some spots.,4
forget coming to best buy for assistance. i hunted around for 20 minutes trying to find someone to help me find an item that i saw online. all of the sales people were busy playing with the new phones. once i found someone he was happy to order it for me but i needed to compare the item to the other products that they also sell. he read the product description off of the internet which is what i did at home. no insight and no offer to find someone who may know more. this is why these places are losing business to amazon!,3
"i want to say one should reserve any harsh judgements for a while as this place just opened up. as with any business when it's first opened there are going to be kinks to work out. the do have a large drink menu, or shall i say they have a lot of tequilas. couldn't get a mojito, decided on a citrus sangria, it was ok. the menu here is very different. i thought it was going to be more of a ""mexican"" style menu, but it was different. so everything i was expecting like refried beans and regular rice weren't there. they only have black beans and brown rice (they have other sides but no other bean or rice options)i'm not a fan of either. their adobo fries are just seasoned french fries, don't let the fancy name fool you. let me say that in my opinion the servings are small, for what i got which was the two tacos, they were small like the ones that you would generally get for the $1 elsewhere for the taco tuesday specials. i'm still interested in their brunch menu which appears promising. the pricing i want to say is above average, one thing that stuck out to me on the menu was a 9oz skirt steak for $24. love new business here in steele creek, here we grow again.",4
"it's the perfect happy medium for a saturday night out in the town and still keeping your dignity.. i had a blast no one was acting a fool besides the fashion victims that forgot we were in old town and not in vegas .. the food was reasonable, filling, and delish.  the salad i had with my turkey burger was out of this world \/service was top notch.",4
"kohinoor is an outstanding non-buffet indian restaurant located near downtown champaign. it is a spacious restaurant with plenty of wait staff, so you never have to wait long for anything. the menu has a wide variety of options which fits well for my vegetarian leaning girlfriend and my lamb loving self. 

perhaps, the best part of any indian restaurant in the naan. here you are presented with so many possible naan options. i've been twice, and keep telling myself that i need to come back just to order a different type. 

this has become my go-to indian restaurant in the cu. if you're a fan of indian food, i doubt you'll be disappointed, and if you're new to indian food there are enough safe options with chicken or seafood that you can slowly figure out what you like without being overwhelmed by a buffet. another plus, they do takeout. 

i cannot recommend this place enough.",5
it was my first time getting acrylic nails and i wanted to find something closer and i found this place. the people here are so friendly and nice. they took their time getting my nails done and it turned out so beautiful. i would definitely go back to this place.,5
"loved it. the rooms are modern plush, and efficient. like most rooms in europe. a little smaller then normal american rooms but unless your going to play on the floor its not really noticeable. it had everything you could want in the room. the pool was great, hot tub was over sized and wonderful. this was a last minute stay and and wonderful surprise. inexpensive for the quality of the hotel 

we where given a coupon to the avalon restaurant that occupies the same parking as the hotel. we tried it and its a must eat place in scottsdale.",5
went here on a saturday night. music was good until 1 then a jazz player comes and people started leaving. ended up going behind it to a place they have pool tables.,3
"i'd give this place another go during regular lunch\/dinner hours.  we came in for dessert only to find they don't really have it so late night snacks it was!  we ordered the truffle blue cheese fries and the first few were good and then the blue cheese taste started to overwhelm the rest of the fry.  don't go here to catch up with friends, you won't be able to hear them.",3
"this is a pretty nice place with good mediterranean food. however the service is pretty bad. when i went there, there were two waitresses and barely anyone in the restaurant. one of them was nice, but the other one with red hair was rude. she didn't seem to care much about us, and she just threw the menus on the table leaving without asking us if we wanted anything to drink. she came back a few minutes later asking if we wanted anything to drink. we got some hot tea, water, and turkish ayran (which is really good!) but she took forever to bring them to our table; the place wasn't even busy. after we got our food never did she once come by our table to refill our water glasses. the food was great, but if the waitress keeps being rude and treating customers disrespectfully the chance i would be visiting this place again would be slim to nonexistent.",2
i visited this location today. the cashier and customer service rep went above and beyond to make sure i received my just for u rewards. excellent service at this vons!,5
"nice place, been using these guys for a few months now and haven't been disappointed.",5
i think the food is good and we have been to many places  it makes a difference you can see in the kitchen best to take out or have delivered.  we find the food tasty we love the egg foo young  the sweet & sour pork so good no grease we have tried many dishes very satisfied if you want gourmet chinese   then you want pf changs people if you want good chinese try it you will like it......,4
omg. seriously omg. this place sushi yuki in peoria arizona is amazing. super delicious sushi and amazing staff. i am super stuffed.,5
"sushi is not fresh. vegetables tempura is disgusting. just a little food can choose.
22 dollars each is not worth. i won't come again. nothing is good.",1
"try their korean rib sandwich - slightly marinated kalbi and tempura on a sweet brioche bun with sesami seeds. first lunch in toronto that i thought was actually good. their veal parm is also great. not cheap but decent amount of meat unlike a lot of places where breading is heavy. 

their hot food bar can definitely be skipped. dishes are a bit dry from sitting there for quite some time especially the fried items although their pankora was pretty good.",4
"i went there several time. it's definitely a choice for you. but it's not like you want to go there everyday. still, they've got good food there.",3
"durant's is my go- to place for special occassions. i have many fond memories of sharing the ""porterhouse for two"", which could be called the ""porterhouse for five"" in reality.
the towering strawberry shortcake is classic and their coffee is worth the drive by itself. i love the decor. the textured wallpaper is classic and seductive. the food is indulgent.
last time i was there i had a spinach salad with my meal and it was out of this world. if i could only do that to spinach in my own kitchen...",5
the chicken feta salad was very good.ingredients we're fresh.service was a outstanding.pink neon decor reminds me of the 60s meets the 2000s.,5
"the worst dollarama location store in toronto, this location which is literally next door to a homeless shelter in toronto's skid row area is always in great disarray, out of stock of most products, and frequented by mainly hobos or recently landed immigrants from the third world who live nearby (many in public housing found within walking distance). unless you're looking to meet your neighborhood drug dealer, make a date with a sex care provider (aka 'hooker'), or experience the ghetto firsthand, don't come here.",1
"it's a lil far from strip but i had a rental car, i loved their food and service and they are reasonable.",5
i went here on a friday to get some grub before a movie on a friday night. i was promptly greeted an seated and the waitress i had was very cheery and attentive ! i ordered the stacked nachos but warning if you order these you need at least 2 people to eat these! the portion is huge and the price was reasonable the bolt reason for the three stars is because the nachos tasted okay and kind of bland.,3
"just okay. for the price it's fantastic but the food was just okay. the steak frites and grilled salmon were good, but no different than what most people could cook at home. we'll be back again since we enjoyed our time, and perhaps it was an off night.",3
my wife and  i are are currently trying to get pregnant and we love this place and our dr. mark severino. we have felt important everytime we go in and everyone is very friendly and imformative! i would recommend this place to anyone who needed it :),5
"absolutely terrible. i would give this place 0 stars if i could. i was with a group of 6 other people and none of us enjoyed our meal. the chips and salsa (a staple at any mexican food restaurant) was a far cry from pretty much any other restaurant in the valley (mexican and otherwise). as for the cost, i would put these entrees (and lunch specials, even) on the ""expensive"" side of the scale. the service was acceptable, although i can only suspect the wait staff expects large tips from their hugely inflated bills. sadly, they may not get any return customers with the quality of their food the way it is.",1
"quite simply, my favorite bar in pittsburgh. i thought maybe one day i would grow tired of ice cold pitchers of bud light and delicious buffalo wings (or spicy ranch. or kitchen sink...). alas, i have not. bartenders and waitresses are great and very friendly. always have the good games on. the back patio is a nice touch and will be great in the summer. all the funky memorabilia gives it a true pittsburgh feel. if i ever go missing, i'm probably there playing darts.",5
"good sushi, fresh ingredients , wide selection including set menus . specialty rolls are huge, i like the dancing eel full of flavour and the lobster salad just phenomenal,  some rolls are average but overall one the good sushi in laval, friendly stuff and nice ambient. definitely recommend it.",4
"watch their pricing!  i wanted to  buy 18 of an item and they attempted to charge me the price for a dozen and then a higher price for the last half dozen!  the cashier said they had only two buttons on their register.  the ""manager"" on duty said that higher price for the last half dozen was their pricing policy!  in the spirit of ""let the the buyer beware"", consider yourself warned!",1
"i was treated by dr. lawrence frankel, dds, ms. from april 2012 to dec., 2013. prior to my dec., 2013 appointment, his care and treatment of my gums were very good. during the dec. visit, while checking his previous surgery, he forcibly dislodged my upper back right tooth by pushing, pulling and yanking it four times with his gloved hand. the tooth had been very slightly loose and he succeeded in making it dangle. it fell out in feb., 2014. his assistant, darlene, was right there. she saw it. in feb. i filed a complaint with the ohio state dental board. as a result, the board conducted an investigation and in their july 24th letter to me, state: ""as a result of the board's investigation and after careful deliberation of all the evidence available to the board, please be advised that appropriate action has been taken to ensure that the licensee maintains the standard of care for the profession.",1
"i was so excited to try this, and i have to give it 3 stars. maybe i need to try again next time i am in town, however it was just ok. i had the eggs benedict (good flavor), but it was served in a dish so the muffin was soaked with sauce and there was no texture, but a big deal but definitely something i noticed. home fries were good, if a bit salty. however with a groupon it was very affordable.",3
"so happy to have found this little gem. service is great, the place is cozy and clean, the food is really good and prices are very reasonable. there hasn't been many good restaurants on this particular area of north las vegas, but with this addition it's looking up.",4
i had occasion to visit pep boys on two occasions and jason doing spectacular job both times. you spend a great deal of time helping me get help with my vehicle. made sure that the work was done properly and coordinated with warranty people. jason conducted himself in a very professional and friendly manner and helped ease my mind. employees like jason will keep me coming back to pep boys. you created a customer with me.,5
solid food.  my egg white veggie omelet was huge.  i would return to butterfield's for breakfast.,3
"this restaurant used to be great. but lately it has declined in both service and food quality. many times we've ordered items on the menu to be told ""we're out of that"". three times in five visits the restaurant has been out of baked potatoes! when i order a steak, i want a baked potato. not broccoli or fruit or spinach! the weird thing is every time this happens, i have to ask the server...was this not noted a few hours ago? as in, hey we're down to 3 potatoes and it's only 6pm..perhaps we need more? because a publix grocery store sits less than 25 yards away from the restaurant! twice our steaks were prepared incorrectly (one steak was completely charred black) and while the manager did bring out the redo steaks, he didn't seem very concerned or friendly. in the past, the same manager would come around to every table to inquire how was the meal\/did we need anything, etc. also i've been dismayed to discover their tuesday night steak deal is now gone and has been replaced with trivia night. it would be fine if this was a bar\/pub. however i was under the impression this was regarded as a nice sit down restaurant for families, couples, groups, etc. and the extremely loud atmosphere with a blaring announcer and cheesy music is one i'm sure i'll avoid in the future as well as many others who have remarked on the unpleasant environment on tuesday nights. also the whole trivia setup is a joke as we noted the one unfortunate time we came in on a tuesday night that practically everyone who cannot be seen by the trivia announcer (which are many) was googling every single question on their phones! that really isn't a fair process but since we weren't playing and ate quickly to get out of horrific noise of the once pleasant restaurant it didn't matter to us. not sure if trivia night will continue but i know several of us who will avoid that now and although it's a lot further away, we will probably be heading to the other location on carmel to see if their setup and availability of food items is comparable to how this location used to be.",2
"red mountain renovations should be your first choice for your flooring needs.  i researched multiple companies in the area and chose red mountain renovations because i felt they would provide prompt service, a high attention to detail and be dedicated to the project...my feeling was right!!  :-)

scott was very responsive to all of my questions and was available for all of our needs.  his installation team was top notch; fast, polite, respectful and showed a genuine care for quality craftsmanship.  i cannot say enough great things about red mountain renovations and choosing them for your flooring needs will be a decision you will be happy with.",5
"i saw dr. h for the first time a few weeks ago.  the front office staff was fine but the wait time was a bit long, but i think it's unfortunately the new norm for any doctor in the valley.  dr. h's nurse was extremely nice and friendly.  i didn't have to wait long for dr. h and was was also very friendly and kind.  i doubt have any complaints about the staff, the nurses or dr h.",4
"they have potential for for their unique taste and style however, when it comes to sushi, we all know how important it is to have good tasting rice. the rice at su&bu is quite soggy and mushy, that leaves the meal end off in a bad note. tried out their poke and burrito with the same texture. 

however, i have to give credit for their samurachi burrito as the vinegraitte in the roll is quite tasty. i had their salmon sambu roll last year at cne and it was a bad experience for me as the fish wasn't the freshest. it still isn't quite up there but they definitely have potential to be better.",3
"i am pleased to recommend dr. rollins and dr. petersen. when i first came in to discuss the rapid palate expander with dr. rollins, i was unsure if i would choose this method or another being used by an orthodontist whom i had seen. dr. rollins took time  to discuss his opinions on why he believed in this particular way of expanding my 7 year old's palate. the same questions had irritated the previous orthodontist who was proud and condescending. when i asked the previous doctor if he could show me any supporting dental studies or articles on why his method should be considered better, he simply told me to look on the internet.  dr. rollins, on the other hand, said ""i will find an article in the journal of orthodontics for you, since you will not be able to access those studies on your own."" and he did! i was able to make the right decision with his added help.

he is always so kind and gentle. my daughter trusts him and only wants to see him. the other day, however, dr. petersen was on duty. it was the first business day after christmas and it was unusually busy. dr. petersen approached and my little girl became anxious. i told him immediately that she was nervous because she doesn't know him yet.

as extremely busy as he was, he began talking to her, ""i am dr. petersen. i should tell you first off that i am a little weird."" she reluctantly cracked a smile as he continued. ""i have 7 children and i'm soon going to have the 8th! well my wife will have the eighth actually.  my son has the same palate expander as you."" then he asked her questions and soon she was relaxed and feeling safe again. he even took the time to answer her question about the difference between white and red blood cells.  i think his ability to detach from the pressure of an extremely busy day and to be able to slow down and focus his attention on a little person who needed reassurance was most admirable.

what a great team, dr. rollins and dr. petersen. 

p.s. they were recommended by abc dentistry for children. i have also reviewed this excellent dentistry.",5
"excellent beers. excellent food... the food is way better than the typical breweries. this place is always packed but i've never had to wait to be seated here. well once, but it was at the other location so i'm not going to count that. 

i really dig the chicken strips here. it's beer battered and quite tasty. probably my favorite chicken strips ever. the chipotle ranch that comes with it is bomb. creamy and slightly spicy from the chipotle. i also like the beer battered fries that come with it. just about anything i've tried here is good... from burgers (they make a pretty damn good jalapeno popper burger), to wings, salads, and pizzas. and accompanied with their awesome beers... it makes one pleasant meal!

only downside is the parking. there is no lot... only street parking. grant it there are plenty of street parkings around but it might require some walking.",4
"very disappointed in this buffet. they didn't have as wide of a variety as i was hoping for. the food was mediocre and bland. i was the most excited for the crab legs. they were soo small and tasteless and not to mention cold when they were meant to be ""steamed"". the crab legs were the main reason for our visit and it was a big let down. the one pro of this buffet is that it has unlimited wine and select beer which was okay. other than that i would say everything else was disappointing and probably will not be back",2
welp. as someone who has worked in customer service for years and now works with the public i know how customer service should be and how it shouldn't be .i have never been so disrespected by a cashier in my life. as i brought up a concern he looked me straight in the eye and said have a good day with a grin on his face and tried to push us along. he completely disregarded what i said and then began to argue with me... hopefully he won't be at that gas station very long as one bad employee can really ruin it for the rest of the staff.  so to the cashier that worked 7\/31\/2016 at 10:30 this one is for you;),1
delicious deserts. very friendly and knowledgeable staff. it's rare when ask someone about products and is told in the most interesting and mouth watering way. reasonable prices.,4
"dee is awesome. i have done a lot of business with the wallpaper market over the years.   first tip; if you need help, advice etc, go when dee is there.  she is so talented and knowledgable of the books and can help you coordinate and achieve all of your decorating goals.",5
"we came here with impressions that there would be a lot of food cooked around eggs.... not necessarily the case. the decor was really entertaining though.... we were eggstatic (stfu). 

a very attentive staff all gave us a warm greeting and presented us with recommendations and specials. we ordered the braised beef short ribs with corn and lobster risotto and the wife ordered the steak and surf. they first served us with complimentary skewers from the chef which was pretty cool.

the braised beef i got was okay but a little bit bland on the inside. the risotto was great. our steak was good but the shrimp was seared... not a big fan of seared shrimp. 

we finished with the cheesecake lollipop tree. there were three flavors; toffee, peanut butter, and bubblegum. a little bit too sweet for me but maybe better for someone with a sweet tooth... or was fat. 


great service and an attentive staff really made this visit a great one.",4
"ive recently stayed at main street station and i must say over the years they have perfected their guest service skills. the employees seemed helpful and caring. the bar has their $1.75 microbrews all day and the decor around the property is vintage but clean. 

the room was comfortable and served its purpose well. a great downtown bargain.",3
"this hospital and the labor and delivery department is the absolute worst. we had our son there back in dec 2015 on xmas eve. he was born fine, everything looked good but they said that he had low glucose. so they forced a bottle down his throat saying that nursing was not good enough (an hr is not long enough to determine if nursing is enough). then half way through the night they took him to the nicu saying that it was dangerously low. the next day his heart rate kept dropping, only a few beats and still in the healthy range but to them it was worth the oxygen and all these other wires. he was there a week and then we got released. they say they are all about the golden hr and nursing and patient experience but we maybe got 5minutes with our son before they were pushing us to the postpartum room. then they discharged me without even checking on me. i was barely able to walk from having so many ribs being out but they didn't care. after we left the hospital we obtained the records from the hospital and it turns out that the glucose was completely fine until after they already took him to the nicu. we are about to have another baby, but i promise you we are not having him there. what should have been the happiest moment of our lives was an absolute nightmare.",1

"i took my parents here in january 2012, when they visted from hawaii. i missed my hawaiian food and was told to try this place. the staff was great especially p.k.. i think we crossed paths back in honolulu at uh?!?!?!

anyways, i had to have sushi and poke. i was so lucky to have p.k. he brought out a malasada to try. ono!

i asked to meet the manager. i think they were scared that something may have happened. i spoked to daniel toves for awhile. he invited me back in for happy hour and to bring my leo friends in next time.

i too noticed the chemical smell, but it did not overwhelm the kalbi or won ton min that i shared.

next time, ship home some malasadas. daniel ships in the dough from hawaii.",4
"when this place was about to open i was living right  in front of it. i surely has huge expectations that were built in all the time they took to put the place on: huge space, nice furniture, different kinds of decoration, a ton of employees training... finally it was open it was such a big disappointment! they were announcing italian ice and gelato. let me tell you... that is not italian ice and that is not gelato. even if you want just regular ice cream the quality of their product is very low. never coming back to this place. only thing to rescue.. clean place and nice ambience.",2

"came here for some late munching (or more like pigging out) and ordered oysters, linguine with clams, lamb chops with salad, and jumbo shrimp.  i'm not an oyster eater but i was told it was pretty good.  the linguine was definitely very very yummy but if you're on a diet, i'd say stay away from this pool of butter.  the lamb chops were average, not nearly as good as the ones we has at texas de brazil the night before, but the salad that came with it was pretty good.  altho i'm sure you're not going to order some lamb chops just for the side salad.  last but definitely not least, the jumbo shrimps.  they are jumbo alright... these ""shrimps"" are more like lobsters!  they tasted so good.  great texture, lightly seasoned so it's not overpowering, and it comes with a little tub of butter.  i had them w\/o butter and they were delicious.  would definitely come back again on our next vegas trip!",4
"this place is close to work so i have been by a few times.  great, friendly service and pretty good burritos.

the one thing they do different here than others is that stir fry some veggies to add to your burrito where most places have the traditional toppings.",4
i've been here a couple of times for lunch. cute atmosphere and decorated nice around the holidays. my fav is the ham omelette with potatoes that reminded me of scallop potatoes. outdoor courtyard in middle of rest cute. definitely senior citizen crowd though and the inside smelled like it too last time i went.  i think fluke. i drank at the bar one time w friend and had good time.,4
"why did i shop at provigo all these years...

finally got introduced to segals by my friend, and i was skeptical at first at how much could a few cents savings do for me, but when the total rang up it was ~1\/3 cheaper than what i would have paid at regular chain supermarkets! segals does have a bit of a sketchy, dingy vibe (partly due to the weird smell of dried fish in the back) but it is definitely worth it! they have the best deals for their veggies and eggs i found, just don't come here for meat since it is mostly limited to sausages. also don't forget to bring a bag since they don't supply them (they have boxes)!

you might come out smelling a bit funky but the prices here definitely are worth it :)",4
"the massage was ok.  she could have went a little harder, but for $20 an hour, i won't complain about that.  i will, however, complain about the fact that she practically demanded a $10 tip.  i gave her $7, and she was still trying to punch in $10 on her credit card machine.  why don't you just charge your customers $25, and take what you want from that?  i was completely annoyed at the fact that they tell you what to tip.  i don't think i'll be going back here anytime soon.",2
"great experience! i bet this place is doing well for themselves. 
you should certainly remember to
- bring cash ( discount)
- check in on facebook (discount)
- don't dress up too much but if you are dress up that's fine too

the duration of a session is 45 minutes, i believe the minimum amount of people is 4.
- you can get a clue ( or as many as you'd like but will still be put to the hall of shame)
- if requested they will save the room details you've been in, in case a of a fail

it took me 10 minutes to get used to the room, just remember, no one is going to come in and pop up lol",5
"stopped in to surpise the kids with an after school treat. walking in, it is very small, very clean and we were greeted by the girl behind the counter . selections were limited in the afternoon, but i see that as a good sign. no waste, everything is fresh. we selected the chocolate cake, regular cream puff and the coffee jelly. portions are small, so you don't have to feel guilty about trying several. cake was good, my son gobbled it up. the cream puff was perfect. light, and the cream inside .... i could eat that by the bowlful. but our favorite was the coffee jelly. pour on the cream and take a bite, it is the most delicate gel and the coffee flavor is so delicious. no bitterness . just perfect coffee. it left me wanting more . will definitely be back.",5
"consistent quality.  that's it!  we can come here for a meal any time and we know what we're going to get every time!  they have a good menu, limited though it may be compared to some other restaurants, but there is plenty of variety for the average family.  and, what they do have, they do well.
here's another thing - they don't mind subbing out the fries on their menu for other side options like veggies!  this is a big deal for me!
i recommend the fish sandwich first.  very tasty and a nice serving of fish on the bun too! my kids like the gyro and order it most of the time.  now that they're getting older and increasing appetites, they're ordering the double pita burger sometimes too.  they love both!
we've always had really good service at this location.  the staff keeps moving around the restaurant frequently checking to see if you need anything.
so, this is a family place with lots of kids present.  expect that.  you don't want to hear them, or be around them?  keep travellin' on down the road.  for those who do have kids, they're grateful that there are places they can feel as comfortable as they do at home.
while we don't go anywhere every week, we are here regularly.  great place, consistently.",4
"reliable, good food and good service. the steak with stilton truffle butter is incredible. they offer lobster tails for 1$ with steak sometimes, but they're small lobster tails so it's not *that* great of a deal. the oysters are always fresh, which is hard to come by in toronto. they also make a great caesar. i prefer sitting in the lounge downstairs, more casual but same menu.",4
"this place is a little slice of white trash pasta heaven. park in the small lot behind it, and you're likely to see some of the methed-out waitresses from the tic toc tavern next door hanging out, downing suspicious beverages. if you like a little keno and weak 70s rock with your pizza and pasta, this is your place.

papa nick's is a tiny, dingy joint, and most of the time when we eat there, the place seems to have 1-2 other tables of people who seem to be related to the owner in some way. service can be quite appalling. i've never seen the same waitress twice. it's like they go out of their way to hire the dumbest women available. for example, tonight, our waitress brought my husband's breadsticks (which were burned, by the way) out on a large pizza pan, the kind that actually goes into the oven. the thing was bigger than our table. did you not have any clean plates, lady? and bringing us boxes for our leftovers was a fiasco (three trips, all offering numerous boxes of different sizes).

that all being said, papa nick's does have some great-tasting food, and meals are served in huge portions that will probably take you 2-3 days to eat. if that freaks you out, some of the meals are available in half-portions (very smart). i don't know if the pasta is homemade, but it tastes homemade. prices could stand to come down a tad, given the area and look of the place. i think we will do carry-out from now on! we only go back because it's the only decent italian place in the lakewood area.",2
"i really want to like this place more but i can't and i don't. the quality of food is just not there, let alone the fact that the ordering process is excruciatingly long.

avoid coming here on a weekend morning between the hours of around 9:30 a.m. to noon. between the crowds and people new to sunflour and its menu\/goods, you will not get out of there under 10 minutes. also, if you're ordering something for yourself and another, you will not get out of there spending less than $10.

the prices are the main thing that bugs me about sunflour. what they serve is not at all worth the amount they charge. the baked goods, cakes\/cupcakes are not fresh-tasting at all. they very clearly are prepared early in the day and then proceed to sit out in the case all day. i find the croissants (chocolate & original) to be the best thing they offer. 

the coffee is all right. they sell all of the other specialty coffee drinks and you will have to wait if you order one. the speed of service is another thing that bothers me. the cashiers usually pull double duty of ringing up customers and making beverages\/plating food. however, there doesn't seem to be much pep in their steps in doing any of those tasks. common sense should tell you that if there's a line, maybe move a little faster?

if you are in the mood for a croissant, definitely stop here but make it in during the non-peak hours.",3
"i used to like this place, and now i hate this place! i would rather be starved instead of going back!

i came here a year ago and the experience was good. this year i came again and it's totally worse than last year. the service was lacking. first of all, we made a reservation through open table, and we were very sure it's made because at first, the hostess was able to see it and be able to say my husband's name correctly. so after we got seated down, we notice that the points weren't added to our open table account yet, so my husband asked the hostess about it to see if they have checked us in. but then at that point the hostess said he didn't make any reservation, i guess they deleted it after we got seated, as we couldn't even see the record on our open table account either. the record was there before we got seated, and then disappeared after we were seated. so we didn't get to have out points on open table and it's definitely their fault, not ours.
at the end, when we got our check, we forgot to show them the total reward card to get the 10% discount, and my credit card has been swiped but i haven't signed yet. so we asked if they can redo the bill for us. they said no because the credit card has been swiped. i got too upset that i didn't argue with them and just paid them and decided not going back. i know that it's not final as long as i don't sign the receipt, they could have voided the one that i haven't signed, and redo the bill with my total reward discount. i know other restaurants would do that as that happened to me in the past. they just needed to void the charge on my card especially i haven't signed. i still give them 15% tip at the end though i am totally dissatisfied with their laziness and wrong doing (including messing up our open table reservation). they don't deserve tip but i gave 15% anyway, as this is the last time they would see me setting foot at this particular restaurant.

i want to note that the service at the one in town square is way way way better than this one in paris hotel. the town square doesn't offer total reward discount (of course as it's not in the casino) but their price is lower than the one in paris hotel. unless you really really really want to look at bellagio fountain while eating, otherwise, there is no point to eat at this one at paris hotel. you don't really see much of the bellagio fountain anyway if you are not sitting at the outside patio.

i am not going back to this sugar factory in paris hotel ever again. i think it's either the employees lacking training, or the management of this particular one is not doing their job well in training their staff, or maybe the management didn't treat the employees well making them staff not doing their job well. 

if you want to ask me about the food, the food is better at the one in town square as well. i always like their red velvet sundae but this time they have changed it to something that tasted so nasty in sf paris hotel. while the red velvet sundae at the one in town square is still good. i visited both within the same week, so the comparison is a fair one. and yes, i had red velvet sundae twice within the same week but at different location. the one in town square is much better than the one in paris hotel!!!!!! at the one in town square, the server and hostess are way better, they didn't mess up our open table reservation, greeted us nicely, always have smiley face. the staff (including the management, not just the staff on the floor) at sf sugar factory requires a lot of improvement.",1
"these hot dogs are fantastic, makes the street meat taste like the crap it usually is, great service as well.",4
first of all its amazing that this establishment will drive so far to a neighborhood that is non existent. they were polite when the delivered and quiet. but the food was cold and my friend mushrooms were soggy. i don't want to complain because i don't live this far. i guess i am complaining. please try harder.,3
"i have attended 4 weddings here.  my review is very detailed: but if you are a future bride and groom please do read the entire post of my experiences. 

let's begin with the most recent, which was last month. after the wedding i spent the next 3 days in the washroom with the runnies. 

the food served was a traditional chinese banquet menu. i should have known when the lobster tasted off and the abalone was way too fishy for its normal taste.  even before the food was served the consenses at the table was: we've all been here before and food is not good.  we were all chuckling under our breaths. a girl at our table had the vegetarian meal. she picked at all her dishes and ate less than 1\/4 of the food. they managed to make lettuce taste bad. the dessert table was the same as last time which i describe below. 

the third time everything went well because i didn't get sick. 

the second time was last year when i was pregnant. i actually threw up in the washroom before i got to the 6th course for the night. (i did not have morning sickness during my pregnancy)

i also had a huge sugar craving and was first in line for the dessert table.  they took cakes out of cardboard boxes that were half eaten. meaning  they served the same cakes from the pervious wedding. ewww i then turned to the fruit platter and the fruit was pale in colour and dry when i ate it: probably because it had been sitting in the fridge for days. the wedding cake was dry and it started crumbling before you could put it in your mouth. 

the 1st time i didn't enjoy myself. i thought it must just be me, because the wedding was held on a sunday and i had work the next day. 

the space: i enjoy the grandness of the winding staircase and the beautiful chandeliers over hanging from the high ceiling. the foyer is good for kids to play during the long wedding. 
the seperator of the halls are paper thin. i couldn't hear the bride and groom speech because the other side was either dancing or had music on for games. 

i know all bride and grooms pour their heart and soul into planning a wedding. i wanted to be there for them and don't have the heart to decline the invitation.  they would ask me how the food was after the fact and i would say 'okay' and try to change the topic because i don't want to offend them. 

yes, the price per person is very attractive because they throw in the back drop, cake, decor, center piece vases to use etc. 

but all i remember about your wedding was how bad the food is and that i got sick. 

from a different perspective my husband was with me all 4 times and he didn't get sick.  his conclusion is that the food is pretty bad. he is not a picky eater.  we've become very selective about what we pick up at the dessert table.  but he spite the glutinous ball that was sprinkled with peanuts, 'tong yun', back out because it was gross. i think that's the rudest thing i've ever seen him do :p it was good that the dance floor was already open and it was dark.",1
"i'm a repeat customer and the last time really left a bad impression.  i rented a luxury suv for a day trip... when passing tucson (about 3 hrs away from phx) i had to put air in the tires.  the next day when getting ready to head back to phx both left tires were flat.  i took it to the only opened shop (it was a sunday) and they informed me both rims were cracked and only bmw could replace them!  i called sixt and told me it was all my responsibility since i declined their insurance.  there was a problem shortly after i rented it so clearly it wasn't my fault.  i thought it was only due to weather\/elevation changes that the air was running low.  my immediate thought wasn't hmmmmm let me turn around 3 hrs and exchange it for another vehicle.  
after $1900 out of pocket expenses and 2 day extension on my rental i can finally head back home... no thanks to rude sixt.  
every time i called sixt (3 times to rude alejandra in phx) they would give me a runaround and excuse after excuse.. ""refer to the contract refer to the contract"".. i doubt their untrained staff ever even read the contract themselves!  i asked one of the girls if she did and she responded with ""well we'r very trained in what could be in the contract"".  so does that mean no? 
i requested the manager to call me back 2 times and still nothing.  the last time i called the phx customer service rep alejandra advised it's monday he's really busy.  alejandra what kind of a response is that? seriously sixt? business basics 101 always respond with what you can do not what you can't... even worse don't respond with a rude answer.  i am a customer!
my point is.. i didn't crack the rim.. there was a problem from the beginning.  every time i tried to explain this i was interrupted.
i am going to be canceling my future reservations (yes i have 2 future existing reservations) and going to be taking my business to a more reputable company.
alejandra no offense but you really need to bring it down to a 2 or 1 with the attitude and take some serious classes on customer service.  absolutely horrible!
on another note.. maria is amazing! have picked up multiple rentals from her and if anything would bring me back it would be her personality and her desire to provide great customer service.
sixt.. i am out $1900.00 but i hope with telling my experience with your company you lose much more.  btw i'm on the board of 2 different arizona organizations as well as a director for a very large bank both who utilize car rentals heavily.",1

- it's large, with lots of tables, so you don't have to wait long for a table.
- the peanuts are fun.
- my kids like it, and they have good kids meals.
- it's a good value.

here's what could be better:
- the steaks are inconsistent and some times kind of low quality.
- the rest of the menu is okay, but nothing special (e.g., salads, sides, etc.).
- while servers are usually friendly, it gets very slow sometimes.",3
"i've ate here quite a few times. sometimes i get excellent food and service, sometimes it's terrible. at night it is extremely loud (don't go there to hold a conversation) and it takes forever to put your order in, get a drink, and get your meal. it's not so bad earlier in the day, especially weekdays when it's less crowded. i usually get the steak and it's quality is usually great but not consistent. the burgers are excellent according to my husband.",3

"the food all tastes the same! how do you makes ""general's chicken"" taste just like the sechuan beef? neither one was spicy, they're both over cooked, and they both have the same bitter aftertaste... how the hell? the chicken fried rice tasted like they made it with old rice and leftover chicken. the white rice was the only thing that wasn't blatantly bad. i spent over $40 on cheap chinese that i wouldn't recommend to anyone. i've had better crappy chinese food at a $10 all-you-can-eat buffet.

seriously... skip it.",2

overall, i would give this place ten stars if i could, love it!!!",5
went here for breakfast...the service was pretty slow.  not sure if it was the half filled tables or they were just making sure they overcooked the poached egg and made sure to burn my girlfriends french toast.  the orange juice was pretty good as was the sausage and bacon.  other than being burnt the french toast was ok.  i would probably find another place for breakfast unless you are drunk which in this town may be a strong possibility at 9am.,2
"auf der rückfahrt von bad wimpfen (u. a. besuch des altdeutschen weihnachtsmarktes - auch eine klare empfehlung !) haben wir das restaurant "" seegärtle "" in böblingen - tübinger str. 7 besucht.
hier muss ich gleich sagen ... ooooh wie schön, endlich nach 2 mehr oder weniger verkorsten essen in bad wimpfen und in gundelsheim ein lokal gefunden zu haben, das unseren ansprüchen voll und ganz entgegengekommen ist.
wie immer - in diesem fall mit 9 personen - haben wir kreuz und quer durch die speisekarte bestellt - über die herrliche maronen- pilzsuppe (3,40 euro) ... über diverse fischgerichte (u. a. zander) und diverse quiche- alles - aber auch wirklich alles hat uns hervorragend geschmeckt.
auch möchte ich die freundlichkeit der bedienung hervorheben, die sofort freiwillig für unseren hund eine schüssel wasser bereitgestellt hat und auf einem teller eine grosse scheibe bierschinken - echt originell ... 
keine frage - dieses lokal lässt sich natürlich nicht mit einem "" gourmet- tempel "" vergleichen ... aber trotzdem haben wir uns alle rundherum wohlgefühlt ...
bei einer unserer nächsten autobahnfahrten in richtung stuttgart werden wir uns sicher gerne wieder an dieses nette "" seegärtle "" erinnern und dieses lokal sicher wieder besuchen.
eine ganz klare empfehlung !",5
it was my first time coming to this location the place is really dirty trash all over the floor the counter tops we dirty also. none of the employees even bothered to greet us. most of the employees looked all sloppy their appearance is not sanitary clothes all dirty. they just lost my business,1
"this place is amazing! my brother-in-law lives a 3-minute walk away from this place, and boy, am i glad he does otherwise we would have never found it! i was having some severe poker withdrawal, and finally came here on a monday night with my husband, his brother and our friend. 

they had just finished a monday night tourney that started at 7pm. we were supposed to make it for that, but got caught up with errands. we arrived around 9:00pm, and played a 10-man 1\/2 cash game. 

all the players we met that night were very cordial, good sport and fun to play with. the dealers, dapper in their matching purple button-downs, were very professional and polite. 

the establishment was very clean and well-maintained. while we were playing, one of the dealers was cleaning and asking if any of us needed drinks. there were a few tv screens tuned into espn, a kitchenette, coffeemaker, water dispenser and fridge. they provide pretzels and a few other snacks, free of charge. 

i highly recommend this poker room! it's a friendly spot with good people.",5
"i've only had this restaurant deliver and the whole family loves it! the quality of the food was superb, the service was fantastic, and the wait was well within what i'd expect for the quality. my husband recommends the chilaquiles con steak.",5
we are new to las vegas and have not found a good neighborhood chinese restaurant until tonight.  after reading the reviews for the golden flower we decided to try it out. the staff are friendly and the food was out of this world. we started out with the best fried won tons and pot stickers we've ever had. the dinner entrees were hot and delicious and they give you large portions. we are definitely going back and bringing friends with us.,5
"so we hit a huge metal debris in the far left lane on #407etr causing a hole in my gas tank. needed a whole new tank and fuel pump not to mention if i didn't recognize the problem in that moment we wouldn't have made it to the right lane to safety. i had my man and my dog in the car. wtf ?! i pay to drive on their highway and then when something happens i get this response. horrible business. we nearly didn't make it to safety and this is the response i get ? not getting away with this. oh and the truck behind me dodged the flying metal that whipped out from under the back of my car -preventing it from going through his impaling  windshield. that is negligence obviously your routine checks are not enough. plus the 407 worker was the one who told me to file the claim and i have a police report backing me. prepare to hear from my lawyers. 

stay off their highway they don't care about you at all. greedy negligence  

this is further to your reporting a damage claim, regarding your vehicle being struck by a large piece of metal debris, while travelling westbound on highway 407 in the area of dixie road, on july 6----

"when i was buying my used ford flex from them, they were super attentive and very helpful. they made it easy and i never even had to walk in the dealership. 

boy, once i agreed to buy the car, everything changed. they delivered the car to me with dents, poorly detailed chrome, a broken seatbelt, a single key and with no navigation system installed. the salesman assured me that, if i took delivery on the car, they would get those things done immediately (and agreed to do it in writing).

well, i've made 3 appointments to get it done over the last month and each time the dealership cancels the appointment since ""they got busy"". 

after a month of me bugging them, they finally picked up the car to fix it and have now had it for over a week and a half. these things should have been able to be done in a morning but it appears to me they may have simply had the car sit in the dealership waiting to get in. in the meantime, i am without the car.

shame on me for thinking that they would indeed do these things quickly once i had bought the car. 

but, shame on them for their post-sales support. i will never have anything to do with any chapman dealership in the future. it simply isn't worth it.

update: first, in regard to the comment that the general manager tried to reach me, i have not received any messages from him. it is possible that he called and didn't leave a message but no message, in any form, has been received. thus, the comment about me not having returned their call is, at best, disingenuous but moreover reflects the manner that the dealer operates. 

second, they finally delivered the car after a week and a half and most of the dents were still there. i am now just dealing with the dent people directly since i have no confidence in the dealership.",1
"some girls drool positively with glee at the sight of perfume counters or beauty shops a la sephora. take my sister for example. me, i go ga-ga inside food emporiums or specialty food shops. you could leave me inside one and find me days later haunting the aisles, eyes glazing over at the multiple possibilities in store. 

so when my yelp buddy christine took me here for a food expedition i was agog at having reached the holy grail of gourmet stores in toronto. yessss...! i felt like i was alice in wonderland wandering the multiple rooms stocked to the rafters with gourmet edibles. if i was having an extravagant dinner party and wanted to pull out the stops a trip here would be in order for the cb is toronto's version of dean & deluca. it truly is a culinary heaven owing to their expansive array of goods and their knowledgeable staff. truffles are available here for a pretty penny. exotic olives and jams they got 'em. need some fixings for a charcuterie board? try their case of pates, sausages and other cured meats. order up some exquisite prosciutto just so you can say hello to 'enzo', their star imported hand cranked slicer. and let's not forget the cheese, for the selection is unparalleled throughout toronto. local, imported, aged, sheep, goat the list runs the gamut. finally no trip here is complete without a visit to their cheese 'cave'-a special humidor created for the affinage, the aging of cheese. the cheese cave is the equivalent of a bank vault: one step inside will leave you marvelling at the valuable wheels of cheese and their heady aromas. some are aged specifically for the top restaurants in town, all lookee no touchee!

definitely worth trip out to the western part of town, especially if you are looking for some special or extra nice! pricey yes so reserve this for fancy schmancy occasions or if you feeling like pampering yourself food-wise.",5
if your staying at mandalay bay it's a must visit. great pasta and risotto.  also very good pizza. my wife ordered their seafood pasta. we went back 3 out of 5 days. it's awesome.,5
loved this resort!!!  family of four with two kids...8 and 10.  everything was great.  did the lazy river every day.  rob volden from the front desk was exceptionally helpful with getting us in a really great casita.  thank you again rob...your customer service will bring us back!!  ;),5
"this is my go-to chipotle since i work really close. the service here is always awesome and the food is exactly what you would expect a good chipotle to be serving.

if you are going for lunch, go before 11:45am or after 1:30pm because between those times during the week, the line is usually out the door (about 15 minute wait) because of all the unlv students there.",4
"drove from la area to joe's just eat and some gambling .  from the waitress to kitchen, everything was 5 star. shrimp de jonghe are a must try for appetizers.  the baked lobster was always delicious but didnt see it on the menu this time. so i tried the filet and tail, on point!.",5
"branched out to the salad world here at waffle house. had my second salad there last night and these things are pretty good if your hell bent on staying healthy and waffle house is your only option. the chicken walnut apple salad was last night's choice and on top of salad mix was a full grilled chicken breast chopped up and walnuts, some apples i believe, dried cranberry and red peppers also. the one salad dressing they include is never enough, so ask for two, but at $7, this salad is a surprise winner and bargain at the house.",4
"the bodyguards are making this place lose customers - big time !!! i would fire them. my very good looking girlfriend, who had a b-day,  and was perfectly nice, was being treated in an extremely rude manner.  the manager ""joe"" was completely incompetent and rude to the young women. this  was a group of 15+ people (mostly women)  . never coming here again, and whoever is the owner , you need to get better staff.  i have gone all over the world, and have never been treated so rudely by a couple of low-self-esteem bodyguards .  sad . worst part ; the bodyguard claims that he lets in only people that are ""in-line"" (we had already waited in the line, btw), but we all saw women that came in without waiting in-line (totally skipped the line) , and he just let them in . the fellow women's excuse was that they are with a ""b-day boy"" , however, the fact that we are with a ""b-day girl"" , does not mean anything to the bodyguards .... hmmm...

our review would be 0 of we could. food was awful and service was worse. worst spider roll i have ever tasted & i mean that because i spit it out almost immediately. we paid $80 for dinner and probably ate less than $10 and not for lack of trying. save yourself some money & frustration - just don't go.,1
"great food. we just ordered from their list of specials which gave a choice of appetizer, entree, and desert for under $30. everything was so delicious that we went back the next night.",5
"my husband and i are salad eaters, so i can only comment on this and not their pizza. we went for lunch today and ordered a vegetable salad and a gorgonzola & pine nuts salad which we altered a bit for my husband's taste. both were really fresh and yummy, although not huge. our bill came out to $17 which isn't too bad. we will definitely frequent this sauce again.",5

"tom is amazing!!! he truly knows not only the market, but he genuinely listens to his clients. he can find you anything your looking for and adds great knowledge to what you may not have even known was out there. he is not in it to win a sale he truly wants to find the right fit for you. he takes time out to clearly understand what it is that his clients are able to afford and how to get them into their dream home. tom is very very patient! he knows it is his job to find he right home for you, not yours. he will give you access to an mls list but so would the next guy...tom goes above and beyond that, he makes sure to get you in a home that you feel comfortable with and even follows up after you have made your purchase. i cannot believe that to this day i still will feel comfortable getting ahold of tom for even just a handyman reference. honesty is key; tom will tell you if its right, wrong, or indifferent. again, he is not in it for just a sale he is in it to find you your home!!! i would recommend tom to my best friend or even a stranger. he truly knows what he is doing and can be illustrated as soon as you call him. pick up the phone or shoot him an email, tom is the one and only relator that we will use again and again and so will you!!!! thank you tom!!!",5
"descriptive phrase: rooftop dance club.

our bachelor party of 9 guys wanted a true vegas club experience and chateau nightclub & gardens did a solid job of providing that. located under the eiffel tower at paris, a gentleman kindly showed us around earlier in the day while they were closed so we could decide if it was our speed. we opted for a bottle service package that saw us get 3 bottles of stoli with unlimited amounts of mixers. the service was absolutely phenomenal. when we arrived we were led through the abandoned indoor dance floor to the hopping outdoor garden, to our own private table. we were introduced to our designated bouncer and server, who couldn't have been more accommodating and friendly to us (and great at their jobs). 

our table was right off the dance floor, which featured a live dj and plenty of people. when we first arrived it was a bit quiet and the crowd was surprisingly varied in age, but as the night went on it became much more 20s and 30s and steadily more attractive. 

the views of the strip cannot be beat, and the prices were more than reasonable for the package we got. it was nice to be outside and with a fun crowd that wasn't overly obnoxious. it could've been a bit more full (there were tables and areas completely empty away from the dance floor, and they didn't even bother opening the indoor area). but, again, service was perfect.",4
"located in the ppg food court.

this is one of the nastier places i have eaten at in pittsburgh.  i believe in giving a place a few tries to make a good meal.  this joint falls ways short.  the employees are about as far from friendly as you can get.  they act somewhat offended and short that you actually placed an order.  

the food-
gyro = literally made me barf
chicken salad = bland and old lettuce

breakfast -
sausage is gross
bacon is precooked and gross (the lady said it is fresh then i see her microwave it)
eggs are decent.
bagel was a acceptable
coffee tasted like dishwater

the employees honestly seem like homeless people with a chip on their shoulders.  could be welfare made them get a job and this joint is a welfare homeless preferred employer.

avoid this place unless you are on a strict diet that requires you to throw up your food.  might be good for gymnasts or circus freaks.",1
"i'm stayed in hotel vdara. i was given a ""four hand massage hawaian "" lomi-lomi"" as a gift. the staff was highly knowledgeable and very informative to my specific needs. the four hand massage was definitely a unique experience. i recommend purchasing over an hour, if money is not an issue, as it took me time to settle and correct my breathing. wonderfully exceptional experience. no doubt, i will be coming back!!",5
"we decided to try this place because a branch of home of hot taste that was previously nearby, closed down.
overall, the service was pleasant.  the facility itself was freezing cold so we ate with our coats on.  the complimentary corn was nice as was the corn with cheese.  however the fried chicken needed more seasoning.  we ordered it plain with sauce on the side and it was quite bland without the sauce for dipping.",3
"stay away!

read all fine print because they will use it against you !!

i booked a 12 person mercedes sprinter and ended up with a 7 person dodge minivan . they have never had a mercedes sprinter. i was told if you read the fine print i would have seen ""or something similar"" which basically could mean any vehicle .

in return they tried to say i scratched the bumper and that the insurance i paid for didn't cover scratches or scuffs.

thank god my cousin works in the industry and has them pull previous records to show the van already had those scratches and scuff marks .",1
"this place is a true treasure in las vegas for all you ethnic foodies who like to cook.  they pretty much carry any type of specialty cuisine you could want and have at least one full aisle dedicated to it.  they have produce and fish and meat as well.  we like to go here to get a few japanese foods that we really love and browse around to look at other things.  they have great deals on huge containers of spices in the indian section.  if you are looking for something to remind yourself of home, they just might have it here.",5
"the new owner has upgraded this place entirely. her staff is far more friendly. her food is way better. my family and i walked out before with the previous owner because the waitress was rude and yelled at my son for not sitting down as he was standing up coloring his coloring book. so, we just picked up and left and never went back until we saw a sign that read under new management and we noticed the name change so we went in and we were very pleased with the food and service. we love the new owner. she is super sweet and friendly.",5
"it a mcdonalds..... how much can i say?!  anyways, its a newly updated location that is very clean and modern looking unlike the older mcdonalds that are out there. the drive-thru has 2 lanes, so there is never a large wait and the service is friendly!",3
so a ton of friends recommended this place to me- i finally went and i was not dissapointed! it was really delicious. i got the salmon tacos- and my husband got the buffalo shrimp taco- it was also really amazing. from the outside you might think idk this looks like a meh place... but trust me just try the food and you'll realize it's a fantastic place. our waitress was also incredible.,5
"what a simply amazing, unique experience!  for my first visit, i let the cashier guide me to their signature burger -- the burger brulée.  check out the menu for the ingredients, which sound crazy, but the result is just stunning.  you've never had anything like it.  

the house bbq chips are excellent.  i'm not a fan of commercial bbq chips as they basically just taste like salt, sugar, and fake smoke.  these are perfectly crisp, with a hint of sweet\/salt, and a very light hint of bbq flavor.  you still taste mostly crispy potato, which is great.

for my second visit i went with a burger of the day that had korean pork on top, with a few other ingredients, and beer-battered burger patties.  again, a crazy combo that was simply fantastic.

the wife had their grilled cheese with bacon, also exceptional.",5
"my boyfriend was in town and i wanted to celebrate his birthday at a good restaurant. we decided to go to bobby's big mistake!  here is why

*our waitress who we later found out was fran would dissappear for long periods of time we could hear her talking to the hostess somewhere in the back but she would could not contact her. 

*our food was cold when we got it. after  nibbling alittle and were ready to leave she was no where to be found. i had to get off our seat to go look for her.

"holy corn kernel, batman!  they must import special (heirloom?) varieties of corn with giant chewy kernels that is served as an appetizer with a delicious dip.  we've eaten here small handful of times and have had decent experiences.  first, peruvian food in general is pretty heavy on meats, beware vegetarians.

the style of the food is pretty simple, some chicken\/fish\/meat, stewed in tomatoes (of sorts), and often over rice.  my experiences with the chicken have been moist and relatively flavorful, but pretty tame on the spice.

the flavors are interesting in the pescado con salsa de camarones (fried fillet of tilapia-esque fish, with a tomato based shrimp sauce).  it was light and pleasant.

estofado de pollo.  this is a chicken stewed in tomato sauce and peruvian spices and served with steamed rice.  it was a pleasant, simple flavor, reminding me of home cooking.

i have had the cevice a couple of times, sometimes limey and delicious, others it has been a bit ""off"".  

overall, the flavors are often subtle, good, and reminiscent of general purpose comfort foods.  the style is not hot, punch you in the face spicy like thai and indian cuisine, but hearty and soothing.  it's not my favorite style of food (i like my flavors a bit more bold), but good for a change every now and then.",3

in my opinion, they didn't go far enough for people who live in phoenix. it may be a good solution for tempe and mesa residents commuting to phoenix, but it isn't effective for phoenicians who want to get from the north valley into cenpho.",2
"second visit and again the food was awesome!  the reason for the 4 star rating is they seem to have an issue with flies in the restaurant.  they were buzzing around our table and the neighboring tables all meal long.  a pain and disappointing for such a good restaurant.  back to the food, if you like calamari there's is the best i can remember.",4
"the chicken and sage waffles were delicious. my chicken was well seasoned and juicy. it's unfortunate that the food service here takes forever! they must have killed, plucked, and butchered the chicken in the time i was waiting. the service wasn't great either. there was a shift change and they didn't bring us the rest of our order. i went to investigate and it was just sitting behind the bar.",2
best steak i have ever had. view is awesome. service is on point and i would return. great drinks and good vibes,4
saying that this restaurant sucks is probably the nicest thing i can even come up with! the food was boring but expensive. the soda was flat the entire night and our drinks would sit empty for 20 minutes before anyone would think to refill them.  the service was absolutely horrible and to top it off when we paid our bill the server also ran my card for someone else's meal. instead of giving me a heads up that they made a mistake i found out the next day when balancing my check book.  when we contacted the restaurant to make sure that the transaction was canceled the manager told us he would call us back the next morning because they were very busy.  no big deal until the phone call didn't come. when we called back to follow up you could tell that the manager was annoyed that we were asking him to verify that the $70 transaction was canceled.  the least that could have been done was an apology but that never came! i will make sure that nobody in my family or group of friends ever return to this restaurant!,1

"boba shop+boba supply store located on spring mountain rd. near ramen sora. having been to perfect scoop (previous business in the exact same location) which also was a boba supply store, i was impressed by the layout. boba supplies are sectioned off and are neatly organized on a shelf. also have few tables but no customers and no music so can be awkward. 

service
walked in and immediately greeted by a friendly gentleman who i believe was the owner, i had a chance to have a small talk with him about their drinks and menu. my usual order to test any boba shop is jasmine milk tea. however, this guy goes ""it's not good. no one orders jasmine milk tea"" so i went with his suggestion, a plain milk tea. 

drink
my milk tea with their original boba came out to be $4.50. not bad for 24oz. this gentleman told me that their milk tea is made with freshly brewed tea, mixed with milk tea powder and other ingredients. as expected, it tasted very artificial and was extremely sweet. somewhat disappointing since their plain milk tea is supposedly the most popular drink here. 

boba didn't have any taste to itself, perhaps the sweetness of the drink killed the flavor. it was slightly mushy but still had a chew. i am most certainly sure they use teazone boba, which is my favorite brand of boba but can turn out bad if overcooked. it seemed like they either overcooked it, had it sitting out for a long time, or both. 

conclusion
just a ok for me. definitely not up to par with all the big boys down the street. go with low expectation and you won't be disappointed.",3
"if you know what you want and where to find it, this store is for you. the customer service is not the best. be prepared to find things yourself. even at the register i have felt ignored. :-\/ otherwise, it is a great place for your beauty needs. definitely my go-to place for bleach and manic panic. there is always a deal to be found here. it's a great thing because you get to try products or brands you wouldn't normally buy for a great discount (and occasionally free).",4

"i am writing this in the satisfied lull of a food coma. the beautiful weather today combined with the general relaxed atmosphere and easy listening provided by the rebel radio station 91.5 (the source) made for one great lunch experience.

being a college student, i'm pretty sick of the student union selection and much prefer to walk to the nearby location to find one of a kind po' boys. i just had the catfish lunch combo ($8) including three strips of catfish, fries, and a mac and cheese. in short, delicious, fresh, and filling.

what i would really like to comment on is the atmosphere. mr. d is a very welcoming and genuine guy. he's got that good old hospitality that really helps bring down the rush and bustle of the day. the decor is simple and helps spruce up what is otherwise a literally a washed up strip mall. (if you didn't know, this place is subject to flooding and happened one year. feels kinda like a revitalized new orleans in here) strike up a conversation, take your time, enjoy the food and company and you will be doing mr. dz fish house right.

it's not that i have time to kill exactly; i have homework to do. but i did need lunch and a break. when i'm done with this review, i'll be heading back to the library feeling surprisingly rejuvenated and calm and ready to tackle my assignments.

homegrown, traditional, family, people oriented, good food. that's how i would tag this place. 

i'll be coming back. thanks mr. d!",5

we came here because of yelp reviews and photos other diners took. a caveat, we knew from previous reviews that this would be more ""americanized"" chinese than yunnan garden, where we ate an awesome meal last night.  but because we were bringing two non-chinese friends with us, this was more in line with what they considered ""adventurous"" dining.  our suspicions were confirmed when no chopsticks were present on the table or being used at any of the adjacent tables.   

we ordered the salt and pepper scallops, steamed flounder, mongolian beef, green beans with minced pork, and snow pea leaf with garlic.  the salt and pepper scallops were pretty good, with a reasonably crisply breading and very hot jalapenos topping them.  one of the two specials was the steamed flounder, and it was very well presented.  however, the fish was unevenly cooked with the lowest half inch of the fish under cooked to the point of still being somewhat gelatinous.  the mongolian beef was salty and drowning in a gravy-like dark sauce.  the green beans were crisp with a decent amount of minced pork and snow pea leaf with garlic was cooked just right.  the veggies were definitely the best of the bunch. 

our first waiter was initially very helpful and filled our drink and food orders accurately.  after that, he checked on us twice to refill beers and sodas, and that was it.  the staff was mostly absent for the second half of our meal.   we had to try several times before finally flagging another waiter to get takeout containers and the check.

unless we have other friends who have very conservative palates, we won't be going back.   there are too many better places.",3
cinnamon burst cupcake. omg. literally the best cupcake i have ever had. not to mention it was vegan and gluten-free!!! the employees there were warm and helpful. my husband and i had a lot of questions about what they had to offer and they were patient with everything. i walked out with an amazing cake pop covered in crushed almonds and the cinnamon burst cupcake. i actually think i'm going back today because it was so good.,5
"our lunch at le st. urbain was as good as it gets, and perfection in every bite. let me tell you why!

chef\/owner marc andre royal is no stranger to the foodie world of montreal. owning two successful bakeries(la bête à pain in ahunstic, and griffintown) which i brunch\/lunch there often. he also is known for his catering services as well. 
montreal cooks cookbook(a must buy if you're a foodie!) has featured him, along with other top rated chefs of montreal. 

situated in a cute suburb of ahuntsic, easy to find with street parking. 
upon entering we were politely greeted by a lovely hostess. we made reservations(which is highly recommended!) and our table was ready for 1:00pm. since it's october and the weather has become colder, we brought our coats. our kind waiter offered to take them out of the way and hang them for us. within only five minutes, i'm already quite impressed with the staff members. 

as we are sitting down, our waiter introduces himself and the menu as well. the restaurant has two different menus. one for the evening and for for lunch time. our lunch time menu came in this very cute little clipboard, with a clear description of each dish.  the lunch menu consists of two stages; appetizer, and main dish. dessert is not included. having said this, i strong recommend you save room for desserts!

in terms of portion size, they are perfect! you leave feeling very satisfied and not overly full or sleepy. i loved that!

within five minutes of being seated, our waiter took our order. deciding what to eat was a challenge for me. why? because everything sounds delectable! so i discreetly glanced at other tables around me, to see what i could get inspired by. 

while we waited for our meal, the hostess came with a lovely bread basket and offered us a slice of what i think it's the most outstanding bread i've ever had in a restaurant. most restaurants in the city do not provide you with good bread. le. st. urbain's bread was simply addictive. dense, moist and with a perfect crust on the outside. this is how well baked bread should be! it was served alongside of a cute piece of slate with your own slice of creamy, cold butter.  we were so focused on the bread, that we didn't realize how fast time flew by. within 10 minutes, our appetizer was served. very beautifully presented! 
we had confit zucchini & onions, served with a creamy goat cheese, slivered olives(not salty) and a light sprinkling of peanuts. outstanding! again a perfect size portion to feel comfortably enough to enjoy our main dish. 

another 10 minutes go by, and our main dishes arrived. once again beautifully presented and served at a perfect hot temperature where it gave me time to photograph our dishes. 

our main dishes consisted of; a loin of pork pan seared to perfection, along with green cabbage, fingerling potatoes, sweet sauteed carrots, in a light sauce.  the pork cooked to an absolute perfection. juicy, and fork tender. 
my main dish was a pot au feu. buttery and tender pieces of braised meat, served with a mixture of roasted root vegetables. along side of a little pitcher of au jus. which is the tasty juices of the simmering meat that was cooked with vegetables, herbs, and seasonings. 

lastly came desserts. we shared a spectacular dish of brownie bites, that had a wonderful and strong pronounced taste of chocolate. clearly a good quality chocolate was used. served with a compote of fresh cranberries, tangy cherries, along with a scoop of sour cream ice cream. the combination of textures, and flavours to contrast the sweetness of the brownies was just perfect!

overall this was an absolute flawless and excellent lunch experience. filled with dishes that consisted of seasonal fresh and excellent quality ingredients. along with very professional, and hard working staff. 
le. st. urbain was placed on my top five favorite restaurants in our city. i look forward in returning again, and again. 
bravo to all the cooks and staff members! excellent job!",5
"couldn't be more pleased and confident in the care provided!!  i started taking my two kitties here abt a year ago when i moved to the phoenix area. as stated by the other reviewers, the care is impeccable, thoughtful, and imbued with such compassion.  dr. marschel has simply been above and beyond with my little guys, makes it a point to check in so thoughtfully by phone when critical events have occurred. they are excellent about scheduling.  their prices are so reasonable. their care carefully weighing all options and the patient's best interests always. they strive so incredibly hard to ensure not only top notch care, but most importantly the very best quality of life for your pet. which is my number one priority. no upselling.  no unnecessary procedures.  no condescension.  no patronizing. just honesty, integrity, thoughtfulness, respect, compassion and the necessary info to make informed decisions for your sweet pet's best interest.  then they execute exceptional care.  they go out of their way to ensure your pet's comfort as well as your own. they have stood by my side, wiped tears and given hugs when things were tough, made a top notch specialist referral when needed (and handled immediate transfer of records and have remained in close contact with me the whole time to oversee care), and have ensured the very best care possible for my little guys at each and every turn.  and my little guys have happy tails (and tales) to show for it!!! :o) i am grateful every day for their services and the quality of life they ensure for my little guys.... and for who each person in that office is as a human being.  so warmhearted, supportive, always a smile and kind word, professional with all the details covered and simply outstanding!! they are truly wonderful. absolutely wonderful!  i couldn't ask for better partners and care for my little ones!",5
i been to oasis vape a few times once before they moved to a new building and a couple of times now it's a good shop. i like the new setup the sitting area is nice they have some couches and a sweet motor cycle on display. the ship is clean and they take your juice order like your at a bar. the juice is made in a clean room and you can watch it be done right in front of you. the mixologist makes some great liquid. all of the flavors i have purchased have tasted pretty good. i have tried some of my friends. custom flavors he purchased from there and they are excellent. the prices of juice are great. they don't sell pre made premium juices which can cost a ton at other shops. i also like this location more than location on power and main. the help is friendly and they know the business of vaping. overall it's a great place check them out in the heart of the ghetto in mesa!!!,4
"all holiday inns are equal. some are just more equal than others (sorry, mr. orwell! you deserve better). this hi has the sort of quirky character that most run-of-the-mill ones do not. it has an english-y pub\/restaurant inside, it is w\/in walking distance to a bahá'í  center and the bata shoe museum (how often does that happen?), and it is pretty much on the uoft campus. the downstairs computers were ok, as was the wifi in the rooms, the staff were helpful about places of interest and provided city and metro maps, the central heating kept me warm at night, and in general things were pretty fine. i would go back, but i'd prefer to stay with friends!",3
"i love this place!  whenever we visit family in az we always go there. great atmosphere, fun crowd, good food and drinks.",5
"good brunch spot on mill ave! fairly quick service. the setup is easy, an order here and sit anywhere flow. i have only been a couple of times, but the bellinis and mimosas are delicious. as well as the breakfast eggs, toast and grilled potatoes combo.  parking is metered with a parking lot located directly across the street. extremely close access to the light rail.",3
"small place attached  to market, but don't let that fool you. the food is amazing! had chicken soltani and beef soltani! delicious!
the taaftun bread is homemade and to die for! the service is quick and attentive! must eat here!  bravo zaytoon!",5
"when i was in arizona golfing we saw this mexican restaurant and decided to hit it up and try it out. we were pretty impressed with the food. i thought it was pretty good, especially the salsa. if i were to go to arizona again and was near, i would go there for lunch.",4
"definitely looks like the place wouldn't be all that. decided on this place after my graduation because i wanted to eat mexican food for breakfast as it was my day. they definitely did not let me down!! the birria de chivo was amazing!! my friend and i both ordered it and we were very pleased with our decision. mom ordered the menudo with pata, it had too much hominy for her taste but as it is she is not much of a hominy person. 

the place can be a hole in the wall but it's worth every penny!!!",5
"cleveland tea revival was open, so i decided to peek inside. you get in and it's kind of small, but you'll notice a wall of airtight canisters and a few people sitting around with tea pots and fancy china. i love tea. been trying to phase out my habit of coffee for more cups of teas. since then, i've noticed a ton of improvements like better sleep, less caffeine headaches, more calm...

since i like my trees green, ordered a pot of genmaicha, which is just green tea mixed with roasted rice. they have a ton of other stuff and can personally help you create custom flavors and special blends. they were nice enough to make a small that had ginger, turmeric, and licorice. it helped settle an upset stomach. 

if you're in the neighborhood, i highly recommend coming in and ordering a pot, but be sure to take your time. you'll be surprised by the menu. i ended up walking out with $20 worth of stuff.",5
"my dinner here was quite a pleasant surprise. i was at tivoli park for an event and suggested brio for dinner since we were there. i dined at a brio at a different location, but it had been a few years. we had to wait for a few minutes, but that's expected on a saturday night. once we were seated, our server took our drink order and then our food order. the wait wasn't very long and the food was delicious. i had the sweet potato & chicken risotto. my partner had the lasagne. my meal was absolutely scrumptious. i was hesitant about ordering it, but my server guaranteed me that i would enjoy it. he was right. i tasted the lasagna and it was cheesy and tasty. there was nothing special about the service. it was average. the restaurant was a little louder than i. ike, but once my meal arrived, i easily forgot about that. i'll definitely go back more often.",4
"had a great experience with media express printing. i needed something last minute, and although it was a small job, they were willing to help me print it in advance, and make sure it was great. 

other printers told me that i had to be there in person because it was too small, but media express was really helpful and fast.

highly recommended, and supporting smaller, neighbourhood businesses means that you don't have to pay ridiculous prices at big chains like kinko's.",5
great dining experience! fun place to try new things and share with others in your party. the charcuterie and cheese platter was a great sampler of unique items and the duck fat fries were without a doubt the best fries i've ever had! the rabbit was great as well as the scallops. service was excellent and the speed at which the food came out was pretty incredible for how busy they were. top notch and bill was very reasonable for the meal we had.,5
i highly recommend the art house in gilbert. i took a canvas acrylic course and had so much fun! the staff was awesome and so helpful. the space is super cute and totally ig worthy. the art house is on point with every little detail. i will definitely be back.,5
"this hotel is amazing! i was so impressed with our stay for my sister's bachelorette party this past weekend that i wouldn't stay anywhere else. it was a busy weekend, but the service was impeccable and our stay was so relaxing. we got 2 bella suites and 1 piazza suite. i love how all of the rooms have plenty of room and it's a great place for a big group to stay with 3 beds per room (2 queens, and 1 pull out). it is comfortable for everyone! i stayed here for my 21st birthday a couple years ago and had a similar experience. the food court it convenient, the rooms are clean, and the staff is fantastic. the venetian is right in the heart of the strip, close to everything, but also has many amenities in the hotel. i love this hotel and would recommend it to anyone coming to las vegas. i will definitely be coming back for the next big event.",5
the dragons here are great they like giant egg rolls.  over the food is pretty good the atmosphere is nice but it's a very small,4
"do:
-print out a two-fer-one burger coupon from the yelp website!
-load up your burger with random toppings, sauces, etc. 
-order a pint of shocktop for $2 at happy hour! 

don't:
-expect much on the burger... yes, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, & onions count as 1-topping each.  defeats the purpose of ""choice of 4 toppings"" with burger (included in price). 
-order the wheat bun... too dry even after i holed out the center of the bun.  
-forget to order a sauce to off-set the dry-ness.  btw, it's +$0.75 extra. 

service: *** [fast & efficient, but nothing else memorable.]
ambiance: *** [noisy, but expected from a burger joint.]
food:  *** [burger meat cooked ""med-well,"" not at my request.]
price:  [print the coupon!]  
overall:  *** [semi-juicy burger on a sorta dried wheat bun... it didn't get all over the place, so it doesn't belong in my face!]

"great all around!

this is a very special place!  excellent food, friendly service, and fantastic presentations. it's definitely worth the trip from the strip or downtown to experience a great dining experience at a very reasonable price. can't say anything bad about this spot, one of my favorite stops when i'm in vegas!",5
"let me start by saying, i liked this place very much. i've been to the market; although a limited selection and somewhat pricy, i have enjoyed what i purchased. i like where they are trying to go with the concept of this place, but the delivery is severely lacking.

i went to their ""movie in the meadows"" event last night to watch elf with a couple of friends and this review is specifically for that experience.

no food trucks as advertised, but they were serving their own food which was their ultimate undoing. we jumped in line 45 minutes before the movie was supposed to start thinking that would be plenty of time. spoiler: it was not. the wait to order and receive food ended up being over 1.5 hours. they started the movie while many customers were still waiting on their food that was ordered so we all ended up missing half of the movie. 

my friends and l all ordered the tri-tip grilled cheese and tomato soup. we watched the grilled cheese sit on the griddle for like 25 minutes. it's almost un-american to not know that grilled cheese takes around 5 minutes to make. we also watched one of the cooks put a sheet pan on the floor and then use it to cover our sandwiches to melt the cheese. all of our sandwiches were burned to hell and mine did not have any tri-tip at all. it was so overcooked, the bread just crumbled like bitter dust. the chimichurri on the side was also very weird tasting. they were sold out of hot apple cider, among several other items. the soup was ok, but extremely hot and burned my mouth. clearly, that one was my fault. 

they were charging $20 for bean bag rentals which is just nuts. i saw one at target selling for $15.

i don't even think they did the ugly sweater competition, but i could have missed that while waiting for food.

they need far better kitchen management before trying to pursue this type of event again. if you didn't get food, this might have been an ok experience, but that totally spoiled the night for us.

i don't mean to be cheap about it, but honestly, i feel like my friends and i should be refunded $54 ($24 for 3 tri-tip grilled cheese & $30 for 3 groupon movie tickets).",1
pretty good little 24 hour diner.,3
always consistently fresh coffee and friendly service.  highly recommended!,5
i spoke to the owner phil and he was very apologetic and understanding.  i will defiantly be back and was glad to get a call back from him.  its unfortunate that we had that 1 bad day but overall all of our other trips to zipps have been awesome.,5
"we gotta luv-it!! on a hot sunday..gotta have custard ice cream.   we ordered a luv-it special and a sprinkle special.  must say it was delicious! ! small place near the corner of ""og"".  will come back for more! !",4
"wow  wow wow. great ice-cream and pure fun to eat.   our group ordered the following combos

1. cookies and cream cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream with hot fudge on top

2. peanut butter cookie and white chocolate macadamia nut with butter pecan and heath bar bits

3. chocolate chip cookie white chocolate macadamia nut salted caramel fudge ice cream with heath bar pieces

the ice cream is rich and thick.  the cookies are satisfactory. the chocolate chip was similar to a basic  toll house recipe. which i find rather boring   the blandness of that type of cookie is a good platform for the ice cream 

the strawberry cheesecake ice cream had chunks of strawberry cheesecake in it. the taste was excellent 

the butter pecan was lacking in flavour ..... would give that flavour a miss next time

the real winner was the salted caramel fudge ice cream. the caramel was so warm and inviting and then the super huge chunks of fudge were amazing. 

the heath bar tipping added that extra toffee taste the was ""the icing on the cake""

the fudge on the strawberry cheesecake combo didn't add much to the dessert. also made it near impossible to pick up. although ordered on the side (if possible ) and dunking the cookie ice cream creation sounds rather like a good option. 

the servings are really generous and the three of us left with a sugar overlaid. next time i am going to share one",4
needed a plumber for a plugged up sink in my residential investment property.  for two days i made appointments and the companies called and canceled for a bigger job or just didn't show at all.  i saw the reviews for rooter ranger and called around 2:00 pm. not a problem and could be there that afternoon between 4 - 6:00 pm. at 5:00 pm danny the plumber called and informed me of his location and informed me of his eta.  at 5;30 danny arrived.  he was totally professional and very knowledgeable.  we looked at the problem and danny explained what it needed and he went right to work. danny fixed the problem and explained what had caused the blockage.  he explained also about a preventative procedure that i needed in an older home.  the best part was it was done for $ 59.00!  i'm sold on rooter ranger and will always be asking for danny!,5

i am still a regular here the staffs here are nice and they do a great job to my fur baby. happy customer here.

enjoyed the lobster & shrimp tacos. nice spot for people watching. service was a little bit slow but we weren't in rush.,4
"this place is located off the i-17 outside of phoenix. there are a lot of empty shops and there's a couple of stores that are worth going to. they are opening up a coach store in october 2011 and even one for the mens.  i like the fact that there are misters to keep cool during the summer.  best avoid on weekends if possible, because when you try to exit the outlet near the gas station, good luck getting out, there is no light and you can be stuck just waiting for it to be safe to cross traffic (if you have to go towards the freeway.   nike store, guess factory outlet and now the under armour store are favorite stores.",3
"they have old rasputin on tap! for my fellow dark beer lovers you must try this, it's soo much better on tap than from the bottle. they also have plenty of other great beer on tap.

i like to stop in here for one or two drinks before going to common market. i love to see all the artwork and just chill out. the bartenders are pretty nice folk.

other than the art and awesome drinks, it's really not my kind of place. i seem to be more comfortable being unknown here, at least by other patrons. the bartenders know my drink when i'm there however.

bottom line, if you like art and good booze, go! it's quite ace.",4
"i usually enjoy traveling through clt airport.  it has a nice layout and the terminals have good food choices.  when i have layovers, i usually think of clt because they have cool place to just chill out and the places in between the terminals have ""outlets""...yaaaay!!  it always seems that my connecting flight is always far away from each other, so you get a good workout for sure.  if you can't take the walk - you can catch a ride.  the workers at tsa and around the airport are usually friendly.  

i recommend clt as a nice hub to travel through.",3
"went to la khaima last saturday based on the reviews i saw online.
the welcoming staff was friendly, the deco was original (to say the least), and it was obvious that the waiter did not follow any basic 'restauration' training; probably à friend of a relative of the owner or something. but that wasn't really an issue..

'can i see the menu?'
'we don't have one. we cook one meal per day, and we offer it to our guests.'

still not an issue..

the lentil\/ginger soup was ok. nothing to write home about, but ok.

the vegetarian plate i ordered?
we were 2. there was enough food for 6 people.

the issue? no flavor!!
couscous and chick peas in sauce and sliced tomatoes. not even a hint of salt, not to mention other spices (or lack thereof).

so here comes the mint tea.
pre-sweetened. did anyone ask me if i wanted sugar in my tea?

won't be going back.",2
"i came here a long time ago back in university. since i was in the area, i decided to pop in to try it again. the ice cream was just as good as i remembered it. 

food:
they always have very unique flavours. i like their roasted marshmallow but it tends to be a tad too sweet so this time i chose the carobe mint. it was really good, the mint flavour is very fresh and balanced with the carob chocolatey flavour.  ice cream texture is rich and creamy. it's always hard to choose the flavours since there are so many unique ones. 

atmosphere:
homey small ice cream shop with some table and chairs and a patio for you to enjoy your ice cream.",4

"i don't generally even drink coffee. just every once in while. but i've seen cafe olimpico frequently touted as the best coffee shop in montreal on several lists so i decided to give them a try.

i got the americano which is basically black coffee. i wanted to experience the best coffee grounds montreal had to offer. i was not disappointed. this was the best coffee i've ever had. the brew was rich and deeply dark brown. the aroma was intense. the drink went down smooth. this was everything i've ever wanted in a cup of coffee.",5
"highly recommend eating elsewhere and coming here for what they do best - sweet treats. 

the food was passable. the burger was of the frozen and cooked in a steam table variety.  think your school cafeteria - the kind of patties with little bits of gray sludge on the patty. the hot dog was actually pretty good, despite i'm guessing it's kept in a steam table\/water also, as the bun was very soggy after a minute or two. fries were awful. choose bagged chips. 

i passed on ice cream but my kids loved it!  they raved. my older son had a chocolate shake, which was huge. i tried a small bite and it was pretty okay. mild chocolate flavor, which i prefer. my younger son had a cup of mint chocolate chip. i didn't care for the flavor at all. personally, my big hang up with the ice cream was the texture. it's just different. that doesn't make it bad, just for me, it was off putting. clearly, this is a lower fat product vs a premium ice cream. more of an ice milk if you recall that type. just not my thing, but that's just me. 

the best part of the trip, and the reason i would take my kids back (just for ice cream) was the experience. really nice, down to earth people - staff and customers alike. it was fun just to sit in the old booths and watch everyone's ice cream creations go by. it's hard to look grouchy with a huge ice cream cone in your hand. the fudge cake and banana splits were especially crowd pleasing. worth a stop for sure.",3
"on a friday night, my family of seven decided to go out for dinner without reservations.

red lobster had a wait time of 90 minutes.
carrabas wanted us to wait 45 minutes.
neither was my pick.

so when my cousin suggested sushi, i almost did a back flip.

hon machi seated us within 10 minutes. the wait is much longer if you want tepanyaki grill seating, but we just wanted sushi.

hon machi nails the simple rolls, and their eel rolls are to die for. i typically don't like eel rolls. they generally are too warm and taste kinda off. but hon machi makes them fresh, with warm eel and cold rice.

the only item i didn't enjoy was the seafood dynamite, which i considered a disgusting affront to all things sushi, even americanized sushi.

the green tea ice cream made a lovely dessert, and hon machi has premade rubber-band chopsticks for kids. my niece and nephew really enjoyed eating like grown-ups.

overall, we gorged ourselves (five adults and two youngsters) for $180.",3
"this is a lovely place for a sunday brunch.  i was invited to a paint party bridal shower here a few weeks ago. i ordered the omelet with the toast and it was perfectly cooked. service was ok, we didn't all get out food at the same time.  portions were large and food was hot and delicious. parking was not great but nothing in that area is. 
i would love to go again.",4
"the new scotsdale location is everything i like about cpc cranked up to 11.  the location is bigger than the ones on university and in mesa.  they have a good sized patio and a pretty spacious interior that is shiny and new. while still delivery some tasty pasty as always.  we stopped in for lunch the other day and the service was terrific.  the wait seems to be about on par with the other locations. it's not the quickest place to stop for something to eat, but it a great choice.  this location actually has appetizers on the menu which should help out a bit for those who are more impatient and or hungry.

try :
- vegetarian cottage pie
- eggplant parm",5

pros) love that they have almond milk. so great for those with dietary restrictions, like myself
2-love the decor. super cute throwback vibe long tables and plenty of seating

4- great music 

cons 
1- why is it that literally every time i'm here there is 1 barista and one cashier on. takes way too long 
2- - i have walked out of here based on my observation of the line 10-12 ppl deep. 
3- i asked for beverage extra hot.. it was lukewarm.... sigh 
4- pricey. 

moral of story. please get more staff and i'll come here more often vs starbucks!",3
"this year was our third year attending the loch norman highland games at rural hill. every year, the event and the venue have been great! the space itself is large enough to not feel crowded, but small enough that it is difficult to get lost. the other part that has impressed me every time, is how well the staff keeps up on keeping the grounds clean. not an easy feat when you consider the number of people eating and drinking while walking through the grounds. 

though we have not yet taken the opportunity, we will definitely continue to consider attending other events here in the future.",4
"i think bear rock gets lost among the shuffle of other sandwich restaurants like subway and quiznos. it might be a little more expensive then other sandwich shops but the ingredients are always very fresh and there are a lot of options on the menu. soups, sandwiches, salads, baked potatoes and pizzetas are all over the menu. there are also a variety of combinations to chose from. i personally really like the moose, rising sunflowers, rockslide, and bear cristo. the honey mustard that comes on each sandwich is really good and a nice change from mustard and mayonnaise. i would give bear rock a shot if you've never tried it.",4
"okay, so my son and i went to rs last friday night. he got the biggin' and i got the 4 rib plate. and that where things got crazy..........

it's been 5 days and i am still struggling to figure out where to go with this review. some of what happened was 5 stars and more. some of what happened was 1 star and less. so i will keep it simple; my son's biggin' was incredible! my 4 rib combo was okay. i would have liked more flavor, both smoke flavor and seasoning flavor. the service was a mix of being both incredibly entertaining and incredibly bad.

bottom line; although our visit didn't go as well as i would have hoped, when all was said and done they did their best to make things right. it's a great little ""mom and pop"" q joint that is feeling the blessing\/curse of yelp and lv weekly notoriety. i have no doubt they will pull through and i have no doubt i will be back.",3

this place was really good.  great food. good price. trust the reviews. place fills up quick so hurry over.,4
"seriously ..... what is better than drinking a margarita, eating a juicy burger, listening to jimmy buffett's great repertoire (\/rep(r)twär\/), and watching a scantily clad mermaid slide seductively (...... and very awkwardly) down a volcano into a giant margarita glass!!!! i ask you..... what??! nothing. the drinks are strong .... the music is great .... you will leave relaxed, full and drunk. 

watch out for pop tops!!",5

"opening shop earlier this year conviction reads like something from a social worker's dream - a high end business intended to be staffed by ex-convicts.  as a fan of great service as much as great cooking i have to say that the concept sold me - how exactly would they pull this off, using largely unrefined servers to deliver a refined dining experience?

arriving ten minutes early my friend and i ascended the narrow stairs up to conviction's beautiful second floor location overlooking king street and were greeted by a very pleasant young man at the hostess stand.  collecting on our reservation the host said they'd ""been expecting us"" and confirmed that he'd heard we made a special request and he would let the kitchen know we had arrived.  led swiftly to a great seat overlooking the street we were both impressed by the unique items being enjoyed by neighboring diners as well as the beautiful layout of the room, art, and tables.  moments later our server arrived - a short, friendly, and somewhat flamboyant fellow - who delivered menus and offered drinks.  clearly somewhat new on the job, especially the brunch (by his own admission,) i have to say that there were many aspects of the service that were less than perfect - menu descriptions inaccurate and water refills slow and requiring repeat requests, but overall it didn't distract from the meal and everyone we dealt with was very pleasant.

waiting approximately 25 minutes before my first dish arrived i can most assuredly say the wait was worth it.  complexly entitled foie gras casserole with maple syrup glazed sweetbreads, boudin noir, grapes, pineapple, and  truffle foam this amalgam of high end ingredients was small in portion yet enormous in taste, texture, concept, and ""wow factor.""  featuring high notes most predominantly from the maple syrup and the pineapple with powerful base notes from the crisp sweetbreads and unctuous foie plus a lingering truffle ""breath"" and the savoriness of the sausage it is hard to imagine the experience without tasting it, but the only dish as complex that i've experienced recently was the egg-jar at the modern.  sweet yet earthy, fatty yet vegetal, crisp at times and other times smooth as silk - all in all brilliant and a different experience with each bite.

enthralled with appetizer it was only a short time before the main dishes arrived - for my friend the omelette pizza à l'éspagnol with ashed goat cheese (a dish i unfortunately failed to taste as i gushed over my own dish and she finished this rapidly and happily) and for myself the pain perdu sandwich with seared smoked pork loin and maple syrup.  an enormous dish featuring two thick slices of buttery brioche that had been perfectly pan caramelized the sandwich housed two thick slices of smoked peameal crusted pork loin and was then doused in fresh maple syrup, fresh fruits, and a pomegranate reduction.  as one might imagine given the ingredients this dish was fantastic - a flawless concoction of sweet and fruity, buttery and crispy, and salty and savory.  enormous in portion and weighing in at only $17 i would personally consider this one of the best dining deals i've recently experienced and would strongly recommend it to anyone who loves french toast, pork, or simply great food.

with neither of us ""stuffed"" and both of us very happy with the food and experience so far we decided to split a dessert and requested the order be somewhat expedited given the time (around 1:20 when we placed the dessert order.)  arriving in only ten minutes we were next served bread and butter pudding, chocolate ice cream and crème anglaise.  the most ""classic"" of the dishes of the afternoon, this dish once again impressed the eye and the palate.  featuring two heavily buttered slices of croissant pudding topped simply with chopped strawberries and creamy anglaise and served in a pool of melting chocolate ice cream i have to admit that this was an excellent bread pudding but i personally would have opted for a somewhat less dark chocolate to avoid overwhelming the nuances of the pudding itself.  as it turned out, though, my friend loved the ice cream while i indulged in the pudding.

finishing up the meal i paid the check and thanked our server for the excellent meal - he assured us he would pass the compliments along to the kitchen, as well.  after a quick trip to the restroom we made our way down the stairs still reminiscing of the wonderful food and were en route to the air canada centre by 1:40 - perfect timing that put me in my seat only 5 minutes before the ceremonies began.  cheers to a chef willing to take chances, both in his food and in his service, especially in today's economy - having had a number of great meals in the past years i can say without a doubt that i'd take breakfast at conviction over anything that nyc or chicago has to offer and i look forward to whatever chef thuet decides to do next.",4

"i was with a tour group and expected the experience to be nothing memorable...but i was pleasantly surprised to find this to be a first class dining experience. even though with a group, there was great beverage service followed by a 3-course meal with a varied choice for each course. service was prompt and attentive. the food was among the best i had in any restaurant throughout the u.k. i will be back in edinburgh next summer and this is on my ""must-go"" list. the noise level is rather high was my only complaint.",5
"eric s.

keith at southern spirits has a remarkable knowledge of spirits at various price points, and is committed to finding the best choice (not always the most expensive) for each customer's request. i've always enjoyed keith's recommendations and would not have found those bottles on my own. friends from out of the area have tried some of keith's recommended bottles (looking at you lot 40 rye) and have gone home to search them out for themselves. all in all, a great store and an outstanding staff.",5
they were busy and i have problems with my legs. they weren't able to show the gracious ability to make sure that i was happy with the experience. so my advice is not to go there unless you are totally healthy. besides that. .the food certainly wasn't that great. no more for me . i'll go back to the great service and good quality of our favorite pizza place,1
excellent food! lots of great options. went for brunch and had the eggs rancheros. highly recommended. can get a little loud in the restaurant and sunday brunch is really busy!! don't plan to go with more than 2 people.,4
"food was solid --- specifically the bread and the french onion soup.  that french onion soup was the best i've had in a long time --- always hard to get the balance on the broth but they nailed it. 

i had the pot roast after hearing a lot about it on yelp.   i mean it was good but i wouldn't use the term ""amazing"".   my husband had the burger which he said was pretty good. 

also it took a very long time to get our entrees out --- i think our waitress forgot to put it in maybe? who knows. 

good food.  i would come back!",3
"i had both an incredibly positive experience, and then a very negative one so i'm not sure what to think.

1st visit - was recommended to this shop by a friend. the guys were friendly, and got me booked in quickly. they diagnosed a broken wire in the abs harness and had me out the door for a very reasonable cost.

2nd visit - brought a different vehicle in for an oil change and check over. the oil change was quite expensive, but i wanted the inspection so i didn't balk too hard at the price. despite showing up early for my appt, and the shop being empty, the service took about triple the time it should and since i didn't have time to wait for the estimate for repairs i was emailed with it the next day. i found it odd that it was quoted in a couple sentences, not broken down by lines with parts and labor costs like every shop i've ever seen. 

here's where i have the issue - i am an ase certified technician myself, in addition to also having many years of experience writing estimates and having access to mitchell (the industry standard program for costing labor). i am in the oil industry now and don't have a lift - this is the only reason i didn't just do it myself. 

the price i was quoted was more than double what the parts labor cost should have been, and it was clear that things had been charged twice. (ie: if you're changing ball joints at the same time as an axle you don't charge for splitting the spindle twice, since it's already apart.) i had a friend at another shop quote the exact same repairs with full retail price and it came in at half. also, i was told my belt and pulleys should be changed due to a noise it made at idle for hundreds of more dollars - the actual source? loose plastic tab on my grille. fixed with one 10 cent screw.

bottom line: they do quality work, but be very careful and get a second opinion with their estimates.",2
came all the way for this. and i should order 10 to go and bring it back to seattle. very good fries! love the cheese burger !,5

literally the best philly cheese steak i've had in my life. they stay open pretty late too,5
wait staff is rude and more focused on talking to each other behind the bar. service is slow. on the plus side this is a good place to see live bands if you can deal  with the club music played on breaks. the overall atmosphere is nothing like it used to be when it originally opened. where is jon taffer from bar rescue when you need him?,1
"great, family friendly place to beat the heat this summer  workers are great and attentive as well as the coaching staff for figure skating and hockey is amazing! i highly recommend bringing your son or daughter who wants to learn how to skate to come and take our 8 week learn to skate program or even start taking private lessons.. the pro shop is usually always stocked and if they do not have something they are happy to order it for you right away . come on down and find out yourself how great lvic really is  very inexpensive as well",5
"when i first heard that john hiatt would be playing at the carnegie library in munhall, i thought ""you've gotta be kidding me.  why is one of the most gifted songwriters in all of pop\/rockdom playing at a fricking library?""  see that's how wyep billed it.  like darren w. states, this place is a well-kept secret.  i'd never been to the carnegie library of homestead (which is actually in munhall).  so what i didn't know was that it's a beautiful 1,000 seat auditorium.  

everything about this library including the music hall harkens back to the gilded age.  built in 1898, the music hall mainly  hosted local community shows, church productions, and graduations.  . but seeking to draw more visitors from outside the neighborhood -- and help the independent library's bottom line -- library officials decided to start booking major concerts at the music hall.  it was renovated in 1998 and since then has hosted such acts as hiatt, patti smith, bare naked ladies, toad the wet sprocket, etc.  lindsey buckingham, drive by truckers, and jon anderson (formerly of yes) are all slated to play here later this year.

the building itself seems to be of a baroque design, common to public buildings of that era.  i'm no architectural expert, so correct me if i'm wrong.  the performance space is quite amazing.  when entering, i was taken by the huge curtain acress the stage and the illuminated proscenium arch overhead.  there are a few drawbacks though.  first of all, parking around here is v-e-r-y limited.  they have no lot, so you have to park on the street.  second of all, refreshments here are very limited too.  they set up a temporary bar for each show.  third of all, the seats are all wooden so they get a little uncomfortable after awhile.

as for john hiatt, i think the trib live described him best, stating that while you might not know his face nor even heard of him, you've probably heard his songs.   bonnie raitt had a  hit with , ""thing called love"" (though she really altered it). ""riding with the king,"" was a hit for  b.b. king (appropriately, though ""the king"" is a reference to elvis presely) and eric clapton as a duet.  others including 
kenny rogers, jewel, delbert mcclinton, joe cocker, mandy moore, and linda ronstadt have had hits with hiatt's songs.  even jon bon jovi did a version of   ""have a little faith.""

hiatt's songs are well known for their wry wit.  one of my favorite verses in all musicdom is from ""slow turning"":  ""and i'm yelling at the kids in the back\/'cos they're banging like-a charlie watts"".  hiatt likes to name drop in some of his songs.  ""shredding the document"" mentions both larry king and oprah winfrey.  anyway, hiatt tours extensively and he seems to be an old pro at performing live and that's a good thing.

you know an artist is still a vaiable songwriter and performer when you stick around for his new material.  he did some  songs from his new cd ""dirty jeans and mudslide hymns"" which were just as good as anything else he's recorded.  and of course he went through a lot of his classic songs like the aforementioned ""slow turning"" plus ""memphis in the meantime"", ""thing called love"", and ""cry love"" among others.  

opening act was big head todd & the monsters, probably best known for ""please don't tell her"".  todd & co. delivered a rollicking good set too.  

i'm at the point now where i'd rather see a show at a venue like this than fork over megabucks for a concert at some mccorporate-name-of-the-month shed.  i'm glad there are still great alternatives to shows sponsored by live nation.  come check out a show here at the library some time!",4
"we live near chef flemming's bake shop which is not necessarily a good thing for my hips; however, my attitude is ""if i'm going to eat sweets, they better be good sweets!""  the pastries are the best i've had anywhere in the world.  friends say, ""shouldn't we share one?""  no, we should share two or three.  i love the cheese danish (more than anything), and my husband's favorite is the cinnamon roll.  the fruit pastries are delectable.

my parents were visiting last weekend, and my mother wanted to pick up some things to take home.  i'd never been in on a monday and discovered something new, salt rolls.  these are large, sandwich-sized rolls with an outside crust firm enough to tap on, an inside that looks, feels and tastes like manna from heaven, and a light sprinkling of coarse salt just on the top.  my mother and i took them home and made fresh tuna salad for sandwiches.  it was delightful.  i went back tuesday and bought the rest (they were now in the day-old basket.)  chef only makes them on mondays, but he said he will make them as a special order anytime.  salt rolls are my new addiction.  i'm off to buy some italian cold cuts and good cheese today to surprise my husband with a most magnificent sandwich.  i told chef fleming, ""this is, like, the best bread ever.""  he smiled patiently, as he always does.

i love having an impeccable european bakery nearby.  it makes me feel very sophisticated.",5
"authentic, filling and i believe it's owned by vietnamese folks. soup base is fresh and served hot.
lunch time got busy fast and we soon discovered this place draws in a lot of hungry fans during this peak hour.

i regretted ordering the fresh shrimp rolls, all i tasted was mint the whole time. should've stuck to our all time favourite, the fried spring rolls. next time for sure.

nothing really out of the box with expectations but getting what you paid for lands this place as my nearest go to pho restaurant.",4
"oh the glory days back at four peaks! i loved this place when i lived in tempe. i was there at least once a week, and i always go when i visit. all their food is excellent including their desserts. the spinach and artichoke dip and the fish and chips are super good. the peach beer which is seasonal is amazing and refreshing. the patio is one of the nicest places to sit, so chill.",5

"have been to ilios a handful of times. i went last night and it has definitely gone down hill. the ceasar salad was below average. i then ordered the ravioli and mushroom dish and it was lacking taste with enough cream to feed a small village. my wife ordered the vegetable soup and it was so spicy she just took two bites. my daughter got the calameretti (sea scallops, gulf shrimp, whitefish, octopus, saffron-tomato broth) - the dish smelled way too fishy and was in a thick tomato paste. definitely not a broth. at this point would guess we don't go back unless hear from friends that it's back on track...",2

"this place is gigantic and has things that i have never seen in orange county,ca. all their baked goods looked amazing. i came in here with my dad and they didn't have the flavor muffins he wanted. he decided to get his second choice flavor, but because they didn't have his first choice they gave him the muffins for free. so awesome. thanks whole foods!",5
"what can one say when the parking lot presents many obstacles ranging from gas pumps, power poles, and above all else other patrons.  it's a mine field but one has to negotiate if your want all manner of sundries.  

on a recent visit i had a gentleman back into my vehicle and together we were able to handle the situation in a gentlemanly fashion.  i have to blame that one on pilot error and not so much the p-lot.  

on my most recent visit, i had to dodge those coming and going but will chalk it up to the morning rush.

what makes this location particularly appealing is location, location, location....cheyenne & 215.

the other factor which makes the running the gauntlet worth it is the employees.  the prices are so so and need i say again one runs the risk of striking or being struck but as far my own experiences have shown me, is the employees are with smiles and friendly.",4
"deserving a solid 4 for the food which trumps any other consideration on yelp, i deducted a point for slow service on a sunday afternoon while waiting to fly out of phoenix. as a korean american, i can smell out good dishes at most korean restaurants. the jjajjang myeon -chinese brown sauce noodles -were the feature dish though you wouldn't know it except for the korean-chinese description of the restaurant. the chinese have lived in korea as a minority community since at least ming times as refugees from the mongols. the chinese food in korea -aka korean-chinese food is a slight variation of northern chinese cuisine which is based on wheat and noodles over rice. jjajjang myeon is a close sibling to peking sauce noodles and this version was excellent with noodles made fresh on premises and cooked perfectly al dente. the tang soo yuk -a kind of sweet\/sour dish with batter fried pork or beef was different from the usual presentation as it used fresh fruit -lemon and berries -to enhance the acidity. the meat was a little tough but overall great. i had the naeng myeon is a cold noodle dish with chewy capellini grade buckwheat noodles and a cold beef broth that is vinegared and garnished with sliced radish and beef was excellent. the kalbi was presented with a 3 inch section of beef rib with the tender meat cut into bite sized chunks was savory and very soft but a little too sweet -most people (non koreans) will love this dish. the ban ch'an -the side dishes were average but clean and fresh. 


don't go here for atmosphere -they have several flat screens running k-drama and the evening korean news cast. the food was slow -the chief had to make a fresh batch of noodles apparently but all the main dishes were perfect. 

i wish we had more of these in cleveland.",4
"had dinner with friends.  i was skeptical as i had read bad reviews from a couple of years ago, all pertaining to the service.  we all ordered the boneless ribs and i had the mac and cheese as a side.  the food was excellent and our server asha was awesome!!  she was very attentive, friendly and had a great sense of humor!   i will be back!",5

"eric kicked our a$$!! i am lucky i work out on a regular basis or i would have really been really hurting. i love the fact that he pushes you outside of your comfort zone and makes sure you are working to your fullest capacity. sadly i am nursing a slight knee injury and i couldn't kick a$$ like i really wanted to but i still did pretty well. from cardio to weight to trx to a nice ""finisher"" (as we say in boot camp) i must say it was a great event! thank you lindsey! (but then again i enjoy working out lol) i like the fact that they give you polar heart rate monitors to use so that you can track your workout as well as email you with your results so you can see just how well ( or not) you did. all in all, if you are looking for a place to work out that will kick your butt, give them a try, i doubt you will be disappointed.",5

"had to have some work done on my car and the dealership recommended black bear. i'd never heard of it, so hubby and i reluctantly walked over to give it a chance. so happy we did! great atmosphere, great people, our server was spot on (even though there wasn't an empty chair anywhere) and the food... i've used a lot of words to describe food at restaurants, but i'm almost speachless on this one. just like sitting at my mom's table, it was that good! homemade, fresh, local ingredients. both of us had great meals and did not leave hungry!",5
"i was looking for a plane model, which i needed immediately for a project, and there were no other stores close to my house which sold any. fortunately, the sentry had numerous different models to choose from, and the customer service was excellent. they went out of the way to, not only help me find what i was looking for, but they also gave me excellent tips on how to build it, and gave me all the necessary materials for it. it is by far one of the best hobby stores i've ever been to!",5
"this was my second time at a yard house, and i guess i'm just not a fan. i just find the food completely underwhelming. 

we started out with the grilled artichoke appetizer, and it was practically raw. it was nearly impossible to scrape the meat off the leaves, and even the heart was tough. this also came with chips and ranch dipping sauce. kind of an odd combo now that i think of it. 

for my meal i had the pastrami sandwich. it was okay, but i wouldn't go back to order it. the meat was a little tough, and the pickled jalapenos were pretty scarce. it was supposed to be served on a garlic bread, but the bread didn't taste garlicky at all. the fries were probably the best part of this meal. they were thinly cut, and perfectly crispy. 

if this was purely based off the food, i'd give it 2 stars, but the beer menu boosts the rating for me. there's a crazy number of beers on tap, so there's really something for every taste! this is a nice location in the linq, so if i'm in the area i'll probably stop by for a drink.",3
"i traveled to arizona for work and was told to expect amazing food. oreganos was the last restaurant i went to on my last day in town, i had been unimpressed for two straight weeks but oreganos wipes the bitter taste right out of my mouth! we sat on their gorgeous patio and enjoyed two pizzas (a thin crust and a thick chicago style pizza) stuffed mushrooms and fries. every single item that touched my tongue was perfect. delicious food all seasoned to perfection and worth the wait. the wine list was a nice touch too. nothing worse than a restaurant that gives you a teensy tiny glass of wine - oreganos did not disappoint!!",5
"every single suit we have brought here, the owner, valentin does an amazing job! his prices are very reasonable as well! we have had him make minor adjustments like hems, but he's also narrowed the backs of suit coats, taken in shirts to be narrowed, and also has also reduced the front of the sit coat so it doesn't look like there is a pouch in the stomach area. rarely does anyone ever do this! he is the only tailor i will go to now.",5
"we went here yesterday for take out on the way to visit the kids and grandkids! what a disappointment. long wait, the food was horrible. i asked before the food was ready if they provide sauce for the garlic knots and ranch for the wings and brenda (the owner?) said ""yes, we provide marinara for the knots and ranch for the wings."" when the food was ready to go, i asked if the sauces were in there, they looked at me all bothered (maybe since i had already asked about the sauces) and rudely said ""yes, there is ranch and marinara.""  well, i should have checked my dang self!  once we sat down to eat, guess what? no ranch - wth!  and a teeeney weeeny container of marinara, not enough for one garlic knot. what a joke! first of all the pizza was horrible, i've had frozen pizza 10 times better than this. the wings were dried up and smaller than i'd ever think possible for a chicken wing. omg - what a waste of $38.00. what people see in this place, i have no idea. was it just my bad luck to get horrible food? will it be better next time? i don't know, and i don't care. i don't plan on ever going back. on top of all that, i didn't even get a receipt! i thought they stapled it to the bag, or put it inside the bag, but...nope! nada - nothing! i give them a negative 5, but it made me check at least 1 start just to post this.",1
"where to start? my husband loved the gin & tonic's here, but not because of what you would think. the circle ice cubes won his heart. he in fact loves them so much we now have molds to make circle ice cubes at home. only they are not crystal clear like jaleo's are, so we fail.

i did enjoy this restaurant. it was fun, unique, and the food was great. the only issue i have is that we spent about $150 (did include alcohol), and we were not full when we left. i'm a big eater, and tapas apparently are just not my thing. unless of course it includes an entrée afterwards.

the food was very good though. every dish (with the exception of one), was amazing. the fried bacon-wrapped dates were amazing, and the paella that we ordered was fabulous. the one thing that fell short for us was something our server suggested, that ended up being a bag of chips (seriously - and a fun-size bag of chips at that), with a ketchup-y sauce drizzled over the chips. 

i did like the presentation of most of the tapas, one even came in a shoe! the atmosphere is very fun and unique, i also love that you can see the food being cooked. we ordered a porrone of spiked cider, and that was fabulous! 

overall, the price is what got me. for vegas, it's actually not that bad. but for me, if i spend that much money, i want to leave full.",3

"paris, i am quite saddened to see how far you have fallen from several years ago when i awarded 5 stars. unfortunately, staying with you did not meet my expectations, and in fact disappointed me greatly.

at the very beginning when i went to check in, you initially told me that instead of the 5 nights that had been reserved, there was only 1 night reserved. i had to get out of line, ask my boss for the confirmation email, then wait in line for 45 minutes. when i got to the front, you shut down several of the check-in desks so there was only one open to the general public. when i explained that i had a 5 night reservation, your check-in agent gave me attitude. finally, she went and got a manager, who explained that while there was a 5 night reservation, only 1 night was paid for. that was fine, and should have been explained before i had to go wait in line and listen to the agent tell me that i didn't know what i was talking about. 

when the time came for me to utilize the cashier, he told me that i needed id, which i'd left in my purse in one of the ballrooms. this was in spite of the fact that the machines were quite willing to take my bills, but for some reason breaking them down into 10's by the cashier required id.

on my second-to-last night at paris, i went to take a shower. i grabbed the top wash rag that had been nicely folded and supplied by housekeeping earlier that day. when i got under the shower head and opened the wash rag to add shower gel, i found someone's fake eyelash stuck to the wash rag. so gross.

the following evening, i came back to my room after a long day at a conference only to find that housekeeping had apparently been snacking in my room since they dropped some type of nut on the floor next to the bed. 

i tweeted a photo of the nuts on the floor to paris, but all they did was offer to send housekeeping up the next morning. i'd cleaned up the nuts the evening i found them, and i find it appalling that they didn't do anything to try to actually make the situation right for me. 

i would strongly suggest staying away from this hotel.",1
"exceptional dentistry is a beautiful modern office with efficient and competent staff, they are always very warm and welcoming.  

i live 30 minutes away and i continue to make the drive to see dr mazaheri for dental care. he has always been more than fair with pricing and has improved my smile significantly. not only does he do his own cleaning and offer general dentistry but he is also quite skilled in aesthetic dentistry. he has a keen eye for detail, perhaps a perfectionist. 

i once had an urgent dental matter and they stayed late to accommodate me on the same day that i called. it was then that i realized the importance of establishing a relationship with a dental provider. 

i'm very happy at this clinic and will continue to make the drive for my dental care.",5

"pittsburgh's parks are all fantastic but this one takes the cake. it has something for everyone. you can walk, run, bike, swim, play tennis, volleyball, and more here. there are wooded trails along with the paved sidewalks and trails. there are also picnic areas all over the park. the reservoir is a calming place to be and the park is beautiful year-round.

you can actually get all the way down to butler from the swimming pool area through the woods, which is a great trail. there's heritage signs all over. you can learn a lot about the area's first white settlers from within the park.",5
"save yourself time and aggravation and go somewhere else. spent over two hours waiting for spot clean on vomit and a vip wash. 

after first run through in car wash found dirt clearly visible on rear bumper and quarter panels, floors not vacuumed and some of the interior not dressed. they also locked my keys inside. wtf? 

when all was thought to have been done the spot clean i originally came in for was not done. waited another half hour. left very unhappy and with my time wasted.",1
"flashy style over substance... it is a shame.  we have been wanting to try steak 44 for a while, we heard great things - really  great things so were excited when the opportunity presented itself to finally go.  we arrived and were greeted by lamborghini's, audi r8s and a few s550's.  walking in the place is loud, the kind of loud that makes you yell at your party to talk and leaves you with a sore throat the next day loud. 

the staff - fantastic!  from the greeter\/hostess to the waiters and waitresses - they were excellent, from start to finish excellent.  professional, accommodating, friendly and very helpful.

the space - very vegas - not necessarily in the best way.  some beautiful woods, high-end finishes, but vegas nun the less.

the atmosphere - lots, and lots of working girls - i love skin but yikes - being gay i do not want to be someones gynecologist while dining at a fine restaurant.  ""russian talent"" was slurred from the table behind us.  hot pants, tube tops and kmdfmp's are\/should not be acceptable dining attire for a restaurant of this perceived quality. there were quite a few professional football players with some coaches and agents.  lots and lots of plastic surgery - enough that any of the real house wives of beverly hills would have said ""wow, she is way over done... i need to go there."" 

food - meh... i had an unmemorable salad, the prawns were way overcooked and rubbery.  the oysters were really nice and fresh with freshly grated horseradish and nice sauces.  then... a horrible bone in tenderloin filet.  supposedly this was a prime cut of beef, but it was neither prime nor tender - i really should have said something then but was so disappointed and starving i just ate it.  no salt and pepper on the steak, the baked potatoes (yes two, assuming they only got small potatoes in so had to make due) looked like they had been sitting out for a week or two and half-heartedly reheated. to be fair all of the other steaks were good to excellent.  but the lobster mash was greasy (not butter greasy) and didn't have salt and pepper.  the highlight was the butter cake with hot strawberry sauce.

drinks - really nice wine selection if a bit to heavy on the overrated flashy wines.   the martinis were excellent and good beer choices.

if i could rate the staff they would get 5 stars - unfortunately the food was so hit and miss that i couldn't give it more than 2 stars.",2
"came here today for a girls spa day and we had an excellent time, we both got full facials.  i highly recommend mel.  take a little extra time to with your appointment to enjoy the relaxation room or shower in the locker room.  they also have great packages for a longer spa day.  they can book up quickly, so call in advance.",5
"i have been staying in toronto for the past 5 weekends and this by far the best hotel i have stayed in yet. the convince of being downtown toronto (in over priced hotels and parking) and walking distance to the hospital does not outweigh the feeling of home you have here. it is a 25 min drive downtown without traffic, but so worth it. 
the free breakfast and coffee in the morning is delicious. the rooms are fantastic! never had bedding smell so clean and fresh. full size coffee maker and fridge is a great bonus. will definitely stay here again! i am actually looking forward to staying again! 
i would recommend this to family and friends. 
thank you towneplace suites for your incredible hospitality",5
"i usually hit this quik trip when i'm in phoenix and need an icy beverage on a 120 degree day. i love their soda fountain because they have different types of ice cubes (crushed, big cubes, etc) and a great selection of sodas made with filtered water. they also have a self-serve milkshake machine and lots of flavored coffee options if you are into that sort of thing. the selection of snacks is good but it's the drink varieties that keep me coming back for more. decent gas prices too.",4
"poor selection. poor organization. staff didn't know their merchandise. i was riding a motorcycle through champaign and got cold as night fell.  i stopped at dick's hoping to find a long-sleeve shirt or sweatshirt. after not immediately being able to find one i asked for help of two employees who were busy folding shirts. one of them told me the only long-sleeves they had were under armour compression shirts or a $40 northface cotton shirt. neither was what i wanted. the other clerk helpfully pointed out that there were some other long-sleeve tees available in in a breathable\/moisture wicking fabric for $30... closer to what i was looking for, however they only had small through xl. the xl looked like it might work, but it had a 1"" long snag in the front. i asked if they would mark it down and they agreed to take $3 off the price. seriously?  i left the shirt. what neither clerk mentioned were the numerous long-sleeve jackets, sweatshirts and hoodies lining their racks. i found those on my own and bought one. overall experience?  meh, below average. i would shop there again, but certainly not with any high expectations...",2

"hired this company a couple weeks ago. move-in cleaning one day and carpet\/tile cleaning the next day. caesar does the flooring and he's awesome! he was thorough with the work, explained everything and even gave me helpful hints on caring for my tiles. as a woman, its ridiculous trying to get honest reliable service work done sometimes. no need to worry here. caesar is your floor guy.
as for the house cleaning, ill prob go thru another company next time.  employee was really nice so i wont mention her name. that being said, she was very slow and did unnecessary tasks. wipe out kitchen cabinets and clean 2 bathrooms takes 5+ hours in an empty house?? i heard her vaccuum 3different times and wanted to mop even tho i told her the floors were getting done the next day and not to do them. felt like the clock was being milked a bit.

"my bf has been asking me to go here with him for weeks. so, although based on reviews i was skeptical to try it out, i decided to be a good gf, and caved in. *sigh* 

we came here on a particularly chilly afternoon and were seated right away. at first we were given a table right by the door, but it was so drafty outside that i asked them to move us to a table inside. once we got in we realized that there was lots of tables available in the restaurant, so i don't understand why they would sit us by the the door. 

we were handed our menus by a somewhat pleasant server, and left alone to make our choices. a bonus of getting a seat at the back of the restaurant was that we had prime view of the kitchen and could see the chefs preparing our meals. the negative side of this? the chef really did not seem to appreciate my curious glances towards his workplace. actually, at one point he stared me down. after that, i stopped glancing. 

another big big bonus of getting a seat in the back? we got to watch the lady who makes the dumplings hard at work. it was very interesting to be able to see her stuff the dough with the filling, and the shape it into the perfect little dumplings. sweet. and unlike her grumpier coworker, she did not seem to mind my tentative glances. 

i chose the king of kings, the bf had the orochong ramen, and we also got an order of gyoza. maybe it was just me, because based on other reviews people seem to really enjoy the king of kings, but i did not like it one bit. it wasn't awful, but it really just wasn't good either. it had no real flavour, and was rather boring and were it not for its gigantic size, unimpressive. blah. 

the orochong on the other hand was better. i enjoyed the flavour and kick in the broth much more, and though it seemed to be lacking on the ingredients, the broth sort of made up for it. 

the dumplings were delicious. the right size and texture, and so very fresh. truly a delight to eat, and the only reason this place isn't getting 2 stars. 

service wasn't awful, and the servers were kind of nice really, rushed and impersonal, but at least we got ""thank-you's"" and ""bye's"".",3
"the line is so longgg and it took forever about 30-1hr wait.. , but it was definitely worth the wait !

the food is great ! the prime rib, salad selections and so much desserts to pick from !!! they definitely had some good japanese dishes and pasta was delicious !! ~ the sushi area.. --eh it was okay. . . it wasnt an asian buffet so i totally get why..

and the service was greeat

totally worth the wait !",4
this nail bar is one of a kind! the best service and exceptional work. i got mani pedi here for my engagement day festivities and i couldn't be happier with my nails. the techs take nail art to a whole new level out with french manicures and in with crystals shaping and high end colours\/designs. i enjoyed my glass of champagne and even ordered lunch while getting pampered unheard-of anywhere. they do party bookings for special occasions and bridal showers i'm planning to do my bachelorette day spa here can't wait,5

"the same folks who used to own la comida ranchera or ole! in gilbert. some say we moved down the street from there to be close to the food. i cried a little inside when they closed.

try the chicken chimi with green sauce. i normally don't care for spice but the flavor is worth the burn!",5
"absolutely amazing!!  

our room had the works: a dining room, fully stocked kitchen, bar, living room, 2 balconies, a separated bedroom, a washer\/dryer unit, 2 bathrooms w\/1 of them being a size of a nyc apartment and had a jacuzzi in it, and them some ... i mean anything we could've wanted or needed that weekend was in the room. -- oh, and did i mention the view from the room?  we could see the entire strip and watch bellagio's water show over and over again.  just a-m-a-z-i-n-g!

of course the lobby is just as breathtaking, especially the chandelier bar.  i have nothing negative to say ... seriously, i tried and i can't think of one =x.

after staying at this hotel i seriously cannot imagine staying anywhere else.

p.s. the pools and clubs at the hotel are totally up-to-par as well ... this hotel just does not know how to disappoint.  ;)",5
"with faux-tuscan arches accented by whimsical italian maxims (due piedi non possono stare in una scarpa--""two feet can't fit in one shoe"") and fanciful chandeliers, the casino-side grotto doesn't promise anything remarkable. so it's all the more impressive to discover it offers many common dishes uncommonly well done. 

we got off to a good start with soft italian bread with garlicked olive oil...calimari toto promises that you're getting all the octopus--authentically italian--fresh but flavorful pieces of the tentacles and head, in a light egg batter that makes it hard to stop eating... meatballs come two near-baseballs to an order, a thin crust protecting the piping hot, almost pate-soft inside (which they claim is all flavorful beef chuck, though you'll suspect more tender veal). the italian chopped salad balances proscuitto, bacon, egg, with gorgonzola and provolone cheeses with iceberg lettuce so deftly that the thin-sliced grilled chicken breast on top seems unncessary. 

chicken and seafood are clearly the strengths here (though they also make their own fresh pastas)...particularly the roasted herb chicken, a half-bird rotisseried with rosemary over white oak and nothing less than tender, savory perfection. 

but the pizzas deserve equal attention, especially considering how few and far between are good pies found in the city. grotto's hand-tossed rustic rounds, cooked in a wood burning stove in the middle of the dining room, taste just like you'd expect from a street café in napoli...but maybe a bit better. our margherita, hitting the table in a cloud of aroma, didn't have a chance of survival. 

the garlicky sweet marinara sauce that accompanies many dishes is the kind of recipe you could easily crave, fresh, simple yet deceptively complete. 

a small wine list offers a baker's dozen reds and ten whites by the glass, including their own robust chianti-esque rock n roll blend, totally acceptable.

beware that huge dessert cart--it will call you, with the signature featherlight wedding cake, dense and deadly chocolate mezza notte, respectable tiramisu, and certainly not least of all, a solid new york cheesecake with strawberry cream, impressively authentic.

lunch diners get a voyeuristic view of action at the tank pool deck, and a limited selection of their most popular items, augmented by some creative panini, and an old school ""nugget"" salad.

i think they have good deals on the pizzas during happy hour.",4
this is a very nice place!  we had dinner here and the place is awesome!  self serve fountain drinks is a great concept....the tables are friendly and the poker room was well set up.  a first class joint off the strip!,5
"i simply can't foresee borders lasting the next decade.  why, even now, would you go to borders?

their prices are the highest you'll find for most every product they sell.  their superstores seem to create huge overhead costs that then have to be absorbed by their books, food\/coffee and movies.  

why would i pay over $20 for a movie that has been out for over a year?  why would i pay $30 for a new release?  why would i pay more for a book that i could get on amazon for 20%-30% less?  even when i get the occasional borders gift card from the in-laws, i still leave feeling like i've been taken advantage of.

i imagine the borders founder proposed his concept the same way that the starbucks founder did.  
""see this paperback book?  i'm going to sell it for $17.  see this cup of coffee? $6.50""
""that's ridiculous.  there's no way people are going to pay that much when they can go elsewhere.""
""oh, but they will.""

i'm going to start the next mega chain by charging $70 for an oil change and putting a chandelier and leather furniture in the waiting lobby.

yet borders always seem to have a steady supply of patrons.  i can only imagine that every one of them is unable to use a mouse and keyboard, or simply has more money than they know what to do with.
nothing against borders fans, of course.  to each his\/her own.  

but why?!",2

"love this place!  if you go, ask for heather. she's so fast and does an awesome job :)",5
"the location is very down to earth but the food is boasting with flavorful deliciousness.
when we arrived there were a lot of patrons eating which was a great sign because it's  proof that the food is worth the visit. we were greeted with a friendly smile and our orders taken right away. our food arrived in a short manner of time and we were checked on many times by the owner, jose and their lovely waitress, jessica. the food portions were good enough for two people. we were full by the end of the meal and already craving for more!
we also noticed that there were a lot, i mean a lot of orders to-go for pick up. it's probably because of the size of the location. it can not accommodate a lot of customers but that has not stopped them from coming to pick up their food. 
two thumbs up for this joint and a great recommendation to everyone.",5
"having lived in worcester, massachusetts (that's woo-ster, not wor-ches-ter) for nearly a decade and being just a 40 minute drive away from boston where they have some of the best dim sum restaurants in the country, i can assure you that i know good dim sum when i taste it and dim sum chinese restaurant is miles from being in the same league as the worst dim sum restaurant in boston.

on my first (and probably last) visit, i ordered just about everything on their dim sum menu. traditionally, you're flagging down an attendant pushing around a cart and requesting them to lift up each lid so that you can peek at the deliciousness that is hidden underneath. if you want the item, they'll stamp your card (which is essentially your check) and scamper off to appease another table. they don't do that at this restaurant. here, you order off a laminated menu with descriptions of the items, which certainly detracts from the dim sum experience.

all the items that i ordered were room temperature to cold. i've honestly had better shumai and har gow from the frozen food section of an asian supermarket. some items were just inedible.  i hate wasting food and generally ask for to-go containers for my leftovers, but i can't imagine their food would taste any better hours later so i didn't.

i don't know if their other menu items are any good as i only went there for the dim sum, but dim sum is definitely not their strong point. i can't in good conscience recommend this restaurant to dim sum lovers or people with working taste buds. if you're craving simple dim sum items, go to the nearest g mart or h mart and buy some because dim sum chinese restaurant will do nothing to satisfy your craving for it.

i miss you, chau chow city. i await with bated breath, until our annual summer rendezvous, where i can once again ravish your hot, steamy buns.

i need a tissue.",1
when i forst came here i thought it was a bit pricy ubtil i got my plate of food. its a lot. i come for brunch on weekends all the time. more of the rock alternative atmosphere.  but dont let that intidimate you everyone is welcome. staff are kind. they dont take debet and dont spilt bills. who dosnt split bills?,5
"the works of picasso are impressive and very profound. we arrived 10 minutes before their last tour. as soon as we walked we rushed to view all of his art because they were closing soon. make sure you don't wear a coat to the gallery because it's humid. i had a pleasant night alongside my best friend, we enjoyed seeing a variety of his work and the metamorphosis his work went through, throughout the years. i find his work to stir many emotions and constant battle though surrealism and the steady depth in the color and canvas. i am the happiest girl on earth to see his work before they left to his family estate in spain. for my first time viewing his work and standing to it so closely, i felt as if i was at his house, and picasso opens the door to his villa and welcomes us delighted to show us his passion and inspiration. 43 years later he will forever be one of the greatest. i do have one small complain and that was the woman who worked inside the gallery of who gave us attitude thought the entire exhibition, she constantly displayed her negativity and couldn't stop staring. i hope next time she doesn't interrupt us, she was rude.",4
"blossom garden is only decent to anyone who is eating ""chinese food"" for the first time here. the food is below substandard - everything is drenched with soy sauce, the fried rice is made up of old, stale rice, and the meat dishes use the cheapest, darkest cuts. if you order a dish mixed with vegetables, you bet you get 10% meat, 90% giant chunks of onion and green pepper. do yourself a favor, don't eat here.",1
"i've been here a few times for rock shows, both as a vip and a non-vip.  this is basically a large outdoor venue with all the usual accoutrements - overpriced food and beer, a pavilion, a lawn that costs less to sit on than the pavilion, picnic tables, etc.  the sound is ok (i think merriweather post's is better) and the location is pretty.  

however, there are some minuses about this venue compared with other outdoor venues.  first off, it is way out in the middle of nowhere.  restaurants, etc.  are a significantly long drive away from the venue.  there isn't a mall or a place to kill time close by, and the roads are not well marked.  i've managed to get a bit lost each time i've come in and out of this place, especially exiting because there is one turn off to a major north-south artery that's only marked with one tiny sign and if you miss that you have to drive all the way around the venue again - in the dark.  also, for much of the last two years the area surrounding this place has had a lot of roadwork going on with orange barrels everywhere.  this is not the venue's fault, but adds to the confusion and congestion, especially when leaving after a show. 

location aside, the venue is also hard to navigate once you've found your parking area and gone in.  there are a lot of exits and if you go in one and then come out the wrong one, it can be very hard to find your car.  it's extremely dark, and again, walkways are not well marked.  the last time i went i could not find my way back to the car afterwards and there was no one around to ask so i found myself navigating all these annoying, slippery, muddy pathways.  the only good thing that happened was i found 20 bucks that someone else who was probably just as confused as me had dropped on the path.  the time before that i likewise had trouble finding the car and was just lucky enough to stumble upon it way sooner. 

driving out after a show takes a very long time as the roads in and out of this place are quite narrow.  given that this venue has been in this location for a very long time, one would think they'd have done some road improvements by now, but no. 

aside from these logistical issues, the bands themselves sound ok and the shows are cool and all that, but the headaches getting in and out just make me wish i was rich enough to hire a limo or bus driver to mess with it for me so i wouldn't have to.  and don't get stuck down here - a cab back to civilization is not cheap from what i've been told by other stuckees.  as others have noted, this is a big place as outdoor venues go, and the sightlines from the lawn here and even from some of the back pavilion are not great, so if you want to see the band and not just hang out, drink and listen, buy tickets for up front.

my vip experience here was just sorta lukewarm.  we were told to show up at a certain early hour to get admitted as a group and do our pre-show vip merch shopping.  when we got there, we found the parking lots were not open, so soon there was a long line of vip cars just parked along the road side in the middle of a forest for a half hour, waiting for the staff to get it together to let us into our parking lot.  when we finally got in and parked and over to the entrance gate (still a dern long walk even with the close-in vip parking!) our hostess was nice, and the complimentary alcohol was reasonably flowing, but the only food we got as vips consisted of chips and dip.  this was our dinner folks...chips and cheese dip.  yuck, especially since this area is not rife with places to eat pre-show, so between that and the arriving-early business, i was hungry!  the people who'd done vip for the same tour in other cities reported that they'd gotten much much better food at other shows.  our seats and access also were not quite as good as the vip package ads led several of us to believe, though i did have a good time at the show.   i don't think i'd spring for a vip package here again.",2
"very poor presentation, extremely dissatisfied with the product. our company placed an order of 150 cupcakes for a major event in the tolleson area, where government officials would be present. the company supervisor and manager both met with the pixy cakes employee to specifically discuss what was expected for the event. the week before the event we find out the wrappers were out of stock that were to be the main focus of the food table, pixy cakes did not offer to search elsewhere for the wrappers so i had to take time out of my work day to google the wrappers, find a vendor and call to see if they have them in stock and then call pixy cakes to inform them of it. the day before the event we went by the bakery to see if we could get a sneak peak of the cupcakes or the 6inch top tier cake--the main focus of the food table as i said, but it was not ready yet. the morning of the event the cupcakes are delivered with the top tier. it was so embarrassing they should have not even been put out on the table. the top tier was to be bright red fondant with the edible company logo-- supposedly the machine wasn't working the day before so regular frosting with barely covering it in red frosting was used and it that were not embarrassing enough, the logo....it was a xerox copy of paper placed on the top! it was horrible!!!! then the cupcakes....despite the great taste, the edible logo toppers were not used and the logo was put on a sticker and placed on the wrapper. now one would think if putting a sticker on the wrapper were to be done it would be done nicely. nope, pixy cakes just slapped on a sticker, any way they could, sideways not even straight as if a drunk person had done it. all this for a $500 order? downright, embarrassing. so all i have to say is that if you use this company......be careful! because if it is for a serious event then you might be in trouble. i would have take a picture to verify all this but it was that embarrassing that i couldn't even photograph it.",1
"i dig this grocery store. they carry a wide variety of products, both brand name and local stuff. more importantly than the items they're selling, this hy-vee delivers a customer experience second to no one else in the area. they're not perfect, they make mistakes, but they stop at nothing to take care of the customer and make things right. i can't imagine shopping for my groceries anywhere else.",5
"prepare to share!  they weren't kidding when they said the portions were huge.  i should have planned better after food cruising on the way to my seat and seeing the size of the plates. they are enormous!  that aside, they are creative!  i posted a pic of the menu. there were at least 5 things in the running for my breakfast. i landed on the sage fried chicken and waffles and my bf had andy's sage fried chicken benedict.  when they arrived we were blown away (see pics).  

my chicken was cooked very well. the batter was crispy and not too heavy. the waffles were packed with bacon in them. but the best were the strips of fried leeks that graced the top and the drizzle of syrup. my only complaint is that i wanted more syrup which could have easily been addressed had i asked my super friendly waiter. 

the benny was also huge and very well presented. the biscuits were warm and wonderful. they were dense and biscuit experts may say they weren't flakey enough, but then they were covered with a hollandaise sauce that had a little kick. the fresh, red mashed potatoes were home-style (nicely lumpy) and an odd but tasty addition to a breakfast dish. 

we can't leave without mentioning the awesome tangerine house mimosa.  the cranberry was ok, but the tangerine blew it away. the food was great but not 5 star outstanding (i rarely give 5 stars anywhere). but i can't recommend this place highly enough. come hungry, leave happy with a doggie bag.",4
"for lunch, i had fried noodles with chicken and a coconut milkshake. so delicious! they really give you a lot of food for the price. :)",5
"but for the customer service, this is a regular chick-fil-a.

a ""regular chick-fil-a"" is a compliment!  it means that the food is addictive (i've switched from the regular chick-fil-a sandwich to the chicken nuggets, which are amazing, and much better than mcdonald's or the like) and the restaurant itself is nice, with attractive furnishings, and very clean.

this location, though, seems to have among the friendliest employees of any location i've been to--and i've been to at least dozens of locations.  cfa usually has very nice and very polite people, but this one is just a cut above.

(sidenote: this location is always packed- the parking lot can be totally full even at 3pm.  where all those people come from, i have no idea, but i'm always still in and out in just a few minutes; there's little to no wait once you're inside, so don't let the packed parking lot run you off. if you're driving down i-85, just turn off and head south at exit 27; you'll be back on the road really quickly.)",5
amazing breakfast. i had the biscuits and gravy and it was great! great place in a great little town,5
"i'm a big fan of writing reviews that reflect my opinion of what the establishment is and what it is trying to accomplish. this place is true to its mission, and honestly, i felt that it did a great job at serving fresh, fast burritos \/ tacos when i visited them recently.

we first tried this location for a school fundraiser, and we ordered online for about 6-7 people. ordering was very simple, and took almost no time at all because of the interface, which was seamless and definitely well-engineered to maximize the consumer's experience. the best part was that online orders do not have to wait in line, which is a major plus when the restaurant is really busy! despite my happiness with all of this, i did commit the most egregious fast food sin: i did not fully check my bags for completeness. lo and behold, they had forgotten one of the people in my group, and their order was nowhere to be found. i recognized this when i got home and we were going through the bag - i immediately called the location, and their manager was super professional, giving me the option of a refund or just to pick up the missing items.

we picked up the items and they were well prepared, as was the rest of our order. i was impressed with their customer service, having dealt with problems like this from other chains before. i must say that i really appreciated them making things right after a long, hard day at work when all i wanted to do was to get home and eat. are they a michelin-starred restaurant? no. are they a group of hipsters that went to culinary school and want to serve braised organic yak tongue on sustainably farmed endangered wheat tortillas? no. they are a chain, and a damn good one at that - they excel at their mission, which is serving huge quantities of pretty tasty tacos and burritos for a competitive price at blistering speeds. customer service is the unicorn in their industry, and they are a golden unicorn at this place. well-done!",4
"great, intimate space with bar on one side of ornate spiral stair and dining room on the other. greeter and wait staff are just lovely - warm and genuine. i love getting beer recommendations and the light beer was perfect. table bread is a corn muffin with spicy sirracha butter but make sure to order the savory beignets - hot, bacony goodness.",4
"i am very happy with this veterinary clinic. we have brought both of our dogs here for different problems and both times we were very happy with the care. the drs. are extremely caring, and we were able to be seen within a day. i especially like the fact that they are open 7 days a week. i highly recommend them.",5
"this is a great place to visit, especially if you enjoy haunted places. our tour guide was great as well, her name was sheryl!  i was spooked easily because i am extremely sensitive to these kinds of things. there were a couple rooms i couldn't bring myself to go in. however, the entire mansion was very interesting we'd love to go again, just wish they give us a little more time to visit and make it an option to visit all rooms, some are off limits. after all we did sign a waiver  we didn't have enough time really look at everything. this is a well deserved 5, if there was more time and to see everything the mansion has to offer.",4
"no complaints during my recent stay.  free self parking if you don't like dealing with valets which is nice to see. i had a prestige level bella suite, which gives you a private check-in desk on the 23rd floor (head straight through the casino upon arrival and pass the security guard for the elevator bank), as well as an open bar on in the lounge on that floor from 5-7pm and a complementary breakfast in the lounge (scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries, etc). the room itself was nice and large, with comfortable beds and a well equipped bathroom.  the casino floor isn't the largest, but has a nice feel to it and the property in general doesn't feel quite as trendy\/trashy as say the cosmopolitan. while i didn't spend any time at the pool, they do have a lot of them and they seem nicely laid out. appears to be far less of a ""scene"" than other strip properties as well, which is nice if that's what you're looking for.  all in all the palazzo seems like a great place to stay on the strip whether it's for business or personal travel.",5
"the recent chef that changed at this restaurant made it for me and my family. this is one of the regular restaurants that we come to now because of this very reason. a couple of years they had a chef that was horrible, my parents didn't approve of his way of preparing dishes and it was just sloppily done. 

doing business with this restaurant has recently created ties with my parents and now well, they have the family going here every week if possible. off menu items are a constant thing every week. delicious steamed fish, sting ray, every week when my parents have the chance they ask what's special to the chef and he blows us away every time.

inside, the ambiance is a nice laid back sushi bar with several big screen tv's and if you walk around to the left side there's a grill for hibachi. everyone is friendly, and the service is pretty good. but honestly, what gets me is the food. the flavor is good, it's not too oily and they don't put too much msg as some restaurants do. 

until they change a chef (which our family hopes they don't) this will be one of the restaurants where we will eat out at, and we don't eat out often. come here, enjoy your time, order anything off the menu and you'll be surprised and ask for some more.",5
"this little diner at the top of mt washington was a great find. the service was wonderful, the food was tasty, and the prices were very affordable. i took my family to eat breakfast about 8am on a monday. it wasn't crowded and a small parking lot is located across the street. i highly recommend this diner for breakfast at an affordable price and good sized portions.",4
"guess the employees decided to show up late this morning.  605.  store not open yet.   i guess the hours of operation on the door is not accurate.    you knock on the door and they just stare at you    

once again.   an hour late opening",1
"tremendous beer selection and good service. food is slightly above bar fare but decent. fun beer events. super cold, please turn off air conditioner when it's 55 outside.",3
"went back here again last night.  had been a little deterred when we tried to come a couple of wednesdays ago only to find, through the unapologetic and off-putting comment of the alleged owner, that they had closed hours earlier than their yelp and yahoo results reflected, but chalked it up to summer hours and a bad night.  when we stopped in yesterday, however, we learned that pallets recently changed ownership and management and is revamping its menu - and apparently its service.  although it was our server's first night, she couldn't find the sweet and sour mix after we ordered our initial cocktails (something we found out after waiting long enough for her to search the entire premises with a fine-toothed comb), eventually made my husband a mouth-puckering-ly poor excuse for a whiskey sour, and could barely comprehend our order.  she had to be corrected twice, although she did ultimately get it right (thank goodness we didn't try to ask for any substitutions!).  after the food came out (and we got up to get our own soy sauce), she was very pleasant and attentive and kept our water glasses constantly filled.  the disappointment at that point, however, spread to the food.  to start, octopus tempura was painfully chewy and flavorless.  having no menu beyond the sushi at this point, we were restricted to rolls and a short list of nigiri and sashimi, none of which was memorable. the three specialty sushi rolls we ordered were duller than we remembered, although the presentation gave us high hopes.  salmon roe didn't have the same pop or salty goodness we expected after finding it at other valley locations.  we left several pieces on our plates as we paid the check and left.  

it really bums us out that this restaurant is going downhill because it used to be a real neighborhood gem.  hopefully this is just a transition phase, but we'll have to have a reason to come back to find out.",2
"overall the food was good and place looks great and clean.  we ordered sisig bangus and it was awesome!!!  oxtail soup was too salty.  monggo beans was okay.  the service was terrible.  started good getting our order quick but it went downhill after that. we had to flagged them every time we need something.  not a single time the server even check on us or ask us if we are okay.  this is my third time eating here and it went from great, good, to bad.",2
"if they ever stop carrying the jeans i like that the regular gap's don't sell, i'm in trouble.  i bought a new pair this past week and they had some sale going on, and even though i didn't have the coupon or a gap card, the cashier gave me the discount anyway.  score!",4
great healthy option in fountain hills.  owner said he makes 90% of all menu items from scratch.,4
unbelievable! just superb. no words to express. it must in your to do list when visiting vegas ! staff is very friendly and they make sure we have a fun ride ! cheers,5
"i've never had a lobster roll until i came here on sat! liz and the chef gave my bf and i such amazing and comfortable service!

so accommodating and the food was delicious! i'm craving their salt and pepper chips and oysters again!


definitely would come back when we come back to lv!!",5
"came in a 8 to order 3 tacos for takeout, i didn't receive my order until 8:45. in hindsight, after 20 minutes i should of cancelled the order and left. wasn't offered any water or chips while waiting so i missed all the hospitality everyone else received in these reviews. when the order arrived, i received a smile and a sorry. 

i have a soft spot to for family owned businesses, but i can't bring myself to go back after this. 

in summary:
didn't enjoy my experience
the food did not make up for it",1
"yelp did not disappoint! cherie was amazing!

i called two months before a wedding to get my bridesmaids dress altered, and i was shocked when the next available appointment was in a month! after reading all the reviews on yelp i was already very excited to meet cherie and have her alter my dress, and that 1 month wait was worth it. she was very nice and friendly, and she knows what she's doing. 

i brought in my dress to get it shortened and tighten around my chest area for only $60. it probably would've cost me $100+ at david's bridal! i would definitely recommend her to anyone that i know, and advise you all to call a couple of months ahead to make an appointment! unfortunately she mentioned that her whole street has to move because they sold honest ed's. i hope she doesn't move, or if she does, i hope to be able to find her! 

ps: it's cash only.",5
"i agree with all the other reviewers in wishing that we would be able to give a & r complete service zero stars.  i have lived in las vegas for over 18 years and this is the worst company i have ever had to deal with.  the only reason i used them was that they are a supplier with my home warranty company.  had i read the reviews first, i would have told my home warranty company to send out another plumbing company.   the tech that came out wayne, was the biggest idiot i ever came upon.  i told him that there is no cold water running in the entire house.  he checked the kitchen sink only and made his diagnosis.  he refused to go upstairs and check the bathrooms and laundry room.  to say that he was lazy and unprofessional is an understatement.  when i called up a & r complete service to complain about how lazy and unprofessional their tech was, the rep that i spoke with could care less. her attitude was just as bad.  because of the poor service i received from a & r  complete service, i cancelled my home warranty with hsa.  they offered no help with this situation.  they are just as bad as a & r complete service.  hsa home warranty has terrible reviews at the consumer affairs website.  i contacted a plumbing company on my own and they took care of the problem.  please -- do not use a & r complete service or hsa home warranty.  there are so many other reliable plumbing companies out there.  always read reviews first.",1
"another triple d! this place was such a blast! the staff was very friendly the, the atmosphere was inviting and laid back, and i loved the funky decor (plastic, light up, yard, easter bunny, lite up over the bar).  they have a huge beer selection & a full bar.  we got the parmagedon (pirogi grilled cheese) and the peanut butter banana grilled cheese...yes grilled cheese!  both of them we amazing but the peanut butter banana was over the top!  it was peanut butter, bananas, candied peanuts, sweetened cream cheese, bacon, (they asked me if i wanted it deep fried!! i passed but i imagine that would be insane!) and a mixed berry jam dipping sauce!  the tartness of the jam really balanced out the sweet of the sandwich.  i would absolutely order it again! the buffalo chowder was great and the hand cut fries had a ton of flavor.  next time we'll save room for the fried twinkies!",5
"since moving to az in '10 i have had a pretty crappy experience with cox as opposed to other providers. the issue has mostly been with the contour dvr's. they are junk. i have had mine replace at least 4 times, and one service call the tech went through 3 new boxes trying to get one that would work. my second box in the bedroom rarely is operational and requires reboots every 2 weeks. the customer service people are helpful once you get one on the line, but that will require a minimum of a 20-30 minutes on hold. i can't speak to the quality of other providers, but for what i pay cox is nothing to write home about at all.",2
"my mom and i recently purchased a bucket of chicken with sides at this kfc for dinner. needless to say, i wasn't too impressed with the food or service. 

after pulling up to the drive thru window, we ended up having to wait (there was no line) for 3 minutes before the gal working there asked us if we needed help. the food cost us nearly $20.00 for the family meal. when we got home and started eating, i realized that we didn't get any butter for our biscuits. 

also, the mac and cheese had a weird flavor in it. almost like it had been sitting for a while or something. i'm not sure. the mashed potatoes weren't very good either, very salty. the chicken, while not terrible, was certainly nothing to write home about. i've experienced better for sure. 

slow service and below average food for us at this kfc. 2-star place in my view.",2
"honestly one of the best thai restaurants, if not the best, i've had in toronto. 

each time, the chicken pad thai is my go-to and it has never failed me. even order on uber eats, it's so delicious and i'm pretty sure they packed more in the container! honestly the best pad thai i've ever had. if you know one better, by all means let me know and i challenge you to try this one. seriously, you'd think plain pad thai can't be amazing but this one would prove you wrong.

the green-curry is really nice, but if you don't get it spicy, it can be a bit bland. loved the flavours, loved everything about it. 

both these dishes are very tasty and very filling. you do feel satisfied afterwards and rightfully so.

the khao so wasn't especially great, i won't lie. the flavour was too strong and was a little oily. maybe it's just not my taste. 

hard to get a table sometimes after work, but the fact that they deliver on uber eats or you can order to go is great.",5
"i'm not sure why people give this bookstore a good rating! maybe the selection? i guess they have a decent selection, but their prices are so high! you can buy used books for less almost anywhere else. also, what they pay you for the books you bring in is next to nothing. this place is in it for a huge profit. you can go to any other used bookstore and get a better deal. for example, i bought a nice bible there for $9.00 and then just took it back and they only gave me $1.00 for it! come on! you can do better than that! i will never go to this store ever again.",2
"meh...
i ordered a gyro...came out in a timely fashion and pretty big too which is a plus...
problem? dry as crap!!!! i should'a  asked for extra tzatziki sauce but didn't think about it until it was half gone but i just threw it down...enjoyed the fries tho and topped off with a couple of stella's... it wasn't so bad but meat was dry and i got about 5 cubes of tomato which made for a lackluster sammich....
try again soon and will update...
cheers!",3
i have had great and honest service here and have been going to them for years.  they have always given me an estimate before they fix anything.  the service is fast and they will work with you on dates.  in the past they drove me home and picked me back up when i didn't have a ride.  i really like this place.,5
"the seabreeze cafe was a great stop for breakfast. they had a special for eggs, hash browns, and toast for only 9.99.  we added bacon to compete or breakfast and it was definitely filing! my daughter ordered the s'mores pancakes and she said they were a 10 out of 10!!  the service was quick and we were able to get in and out quickly. i'll be back for breakfast!",5
"not impressed with this place at all. came here on a monday night looking to eat dinner and ended up eating desert because i really didn't like anything on their over priced menu. 

ended up ordering east meets west crepe and was so disappointed to see the plate they brought to me that consisted of 2 small crepes wrapped around the 2 ice cream scoops. this plate was $9.75 which was well over priced. 

they get 2 stars for good service by a server in training. he was very attentive and didn't hold back on asking us if we were okay. 

won't be back here.",2
everyone moves quickly and always gets my order right. my wife turned me on to frappacinos and well now this is our go to ! a caffeinated wife is a happy wife :-),5
food was fantastic!.. we had so much to eat! love my seafood.. staff was friendly. the women's restroom are disgusting! there's vomit on the doors! never will i ever return because of that reason.,2
"we have been to this particular yolies in the past.  this place has gone extremely down hill since the last time we were there!  the service was horrible, they didn't even have a cocktail waitress so the elderly female owner took orders, and she screwed most of them up.  the sides to the main dinner were also horrible!  the vegetables were served cold, and were served 15 minutes before the meat showed up.  the salad dressing tasted like pure vinegar, i couldn't eat it.  the meat was fair\/good.  they had one server for about 70 people, 2 tables of 18 walked out.  my only regret was we didn't leave with them.  what should have been a 2 hour dining experience turned into a 4 hour one!  time for the owners to retire and sell this place, because the doors won't be open for very long!  there are so many good restaurants in vegas, don't waste your time or money on this restaurant!  oh yeah, and another thing, the guy serving the meat spilled blood from the beef plate all over 2 people at our table.  they didn't even offer to clean their shirts!  an awful experience to say the least!",1
"popped in here for a late lunch while in edinburgh for a day out. we didn't plan to come in here but decided that the exterior looked really quirky so decided to try! 

as you enter it looks like your usual coffee shop - some seating areas and a large blackboard over the till area with your menu and drinks - so there i was waiting to order at the till as you do. but turns out it's an actual restaurant which was a surprise to us as we were looking for something quick. but we decided to just stay as we were just starving! 

we were taken to the upstairs level of the restaurant, which was nice as a lot of the decor and flooring was wooden so it felt a bit like you were in a tree house.. 

the staff and food was lovely, however it is probably on the pricey side considering it was a sort of coffee shop with a restaurant priced menu. 

overall was a good experience, will recommend :)",4
"excellent happy hour!   been coming here for past 2 yrs and we typically sit in the very comfy booths in bar area.  love the pizza, deep fried asparagus.  portions are good.  drinks are wonderful. service is excellent. highly recommend as a neighborhood favorite!",4
"went for lunch and the buffet is gone! miss it! lunch item prices should be lower, smaller portions, but it's one menu for all. not wise. food is always excellent. service okay. don't know when i'll go back. just for dinner.",3
"this place is fun for kids and adults! it can be a little on the expensive side, but wow is this an improvement from the old flip n out on that was over on craig rd.  this location has at least double the trampoline space and a much better layout.  the laser tag is awesome - 4 levels, great design, good equipment. there is also a ""ninja warrior"" area but i'm too fat to even attempt it.  i did try the zip line - once - and decided i'm a little portly for that type of fun.  my kids had a great time and begged me to stay another hour.  good job on this location guys!",5
"laura henderson of remax was the most helpful and the most kind to me of all the people involved in finding me somewhere to live under some urgent circumstances.  i was living out of my car, waiting for the check to come in, and she kept in touch and kept me posted the whole time i worked with her.

ultimately, the apartment i rented wasn't from her sources, but, her kindness and her dedication was unparalleled--if i was her boss i would be giving her some kind of commendation or reward for such good service.

she's good people.",5
"wir waren das erste mal dort,mit übernachtung. nachdem wir eingecheckt haben setzten wir uns auf die terrasse um was zu essen. nachdem wie die speisekarte geschrieben ist,könnte man meinen in einen gourmet-restaurant zu essen. aber mitnichten,unser essen war eine katastrophe,die sauce eine pampe,mit viel zu viel alkohol und das fleisch war trocken. am nächsten morgen beim frühstück das sonntags nur von 8-10 uhr geht erwartete uns ein leeres büffet,nicht abgeräumte tische. nachdem wir die frau angesprochen haben wo wir uns denn hinsetzen können wurden wir pampig angesprochen,sie könne nicht alles machen. auch die2. servicekraft,die dann irgendwann kam war total unprofessionell und überfordert. wir mussten zweimal nach besteck fragen,der kaffe wurde erst nach mehrmaligen anfragen serviert.

also,so kann man kein hotel führen,mit schlechtgelaunten mitarbeiter und katastrphalen servicekräften",1
"i've been using custom maids for 3-4 years. i've had 2 maids over that period and both were on time, friendly, reliable and trustworthy (first one moved away unfortunately!). i have no issues leaving my keys for my cleaning to be done if i am out of town and if i leave specific cleaning instructions they are followed. they charge a bit of a premium for a reason. i would recommend them to anyone looking for reliable cleaning.",5
"so this review is for erika, i've been going to her for about 3 years now and she's honestly the best. i usually get just a brow but i've expanded to half arm and brazilian. she's extremely quick and efficient. i love talking to her she makes you feel really comfortable and knows what she's doing. i moved to ca but still come back just to get waxed by her. i started taking my little sister to her (who happened to be extremely nervous) and erika is great with her. do yourself a favor and make an appointment with erika and see for yourself. :)",5
"detour vegas is awesome! they're a family owned business and do a great job with the atv tour. my friends really enjoyed it, even though it was 96 degrees in july. the best part were the snacks at the end. they provided water, chips, fruit snacks, watermelon, and beer. excellent customer service!",5
"best pizza place i've found, ever! great owners who are both welcoming and very friendly. it is a weekly spot for my wife and i and it never gets old!",5
"at first groupon glance, i thought, ""well... glass blowing can be fun! but, what if i burn myself? that would be me. i'd be remembered as the one who burned herself,"" and i never thought anything of it again. then, my coworkers, wendy and donna, talked me into trying it out.

there is an introductory class, but wendy and donna had already gone past that, so i decided to hang out with the big crowd and jump right in. it was no sweat at all. the instructors walk you through the procedure each step of the way. introductory class or not, the instructors first describe what they're going to do, then they demonstrate it. next, you are walked through it just like a parent holding their child's hand while crossing the street. the instructors constantly ask if you have any questions and add humor along the way. creating glass pumpkins was a great way to spend a saturday afternoon without worrying about anything. within 10 minutes, i started with a melted 2000 degree blob and ended with a beautiful glass pumpkin!",5
"it's great for what it is and where it is. it's a simple mediterranean restaurant on mcneilly road. you want food elsewhere on mcneilly it's going to be wings, hoagies, or mufflers. the street is basically an industrial park so it's a nice easter egg.

it's hard to travel the travel the world experiencing all of the great cuisine and then move to a ""sandwich"" town. so it's refreshing to have mediterranean food that isn't just a gyro with fries. lovely to have seafood that isn't just breaded pollack with potato chips.

i don't know how fresh or authentic any of the ingredients are or what they are doing in the kitchen, but at least they are trying and pulling it off. at least they aren't the one millionth lousy pizza place in pittsburgh. very nice folks of course. homey understated atmosphere. reasonably priced. definitely worth the tab.",4
"humble ""mom 'n pop"" place.

great hang out for couples, families, kids or a quiet time alone enjoying the scrumptious deals!

friendly, helpful owners. generous portions, made-to-order the way you want it. fresh ingredients and free drink refills.

an all around quiet and calm place.",5
"point brugge cafe has, in my opinion, the best mussels in pittsburgh.  i know this is not an outlandish claim, because this viewpoint is shared by many of the boutique restaurant patrons.  an afternoon or evening with the point brugge staff is truly a step into northern belgium, for classic flemish cuisine.  from the frites with basil mayonnaise to the prince edward isle mussels, the experience is delightful.  

the cafe offers three types of moules (mussels), my favorite being the red curry moules with brugge frites. the classic white wine and zesty tomato options are also very good.  all of the moules options pair nicely with a belgian beer selection from the bar.

i would recommend this as a great location to share with family or your significant other.  point brugge cafe will soon become a new favorite.",5
"good food, but their customer service is less than professional.  i walked in with a friend for brunch.  i stood in line to order and she went to sit at a table.  there was a guy ""policing"" the seating and told her that she couldn't sit down until we had ordered our food.  there were 3 parties in front of me, so he made her stand to the side of the counter in the hallway leading to the bathrooms.  seriously???  so we turned around and left.

so we gave the business a second chance since, like i said, their food is good.  we arrived at the restaurant at 2:45p.  when we got to the counter, the lady\/owner said they close at 3:00p, so we would have to eat outside while they close up the restaurant.  i reminded her that it was only 2:45p and she said they start closing at 2:45p so they can be out of the restaurant by 3:00p.  again, seriously???  (mind you, under normal circumstances, i wouldn't mind eating outside, but in vegas in july\/august, no one wants to be outside more than they have to be).

we will no longer be going back to give our business, based solely on their lack of customer service.  i can honestly say that i've never come across a small business that cares so little about  customer business\/service.",2
"food was amazing but service was lacking. we waited forever just to get menus. then forever for water. people were seated beside us 15 min after us and they got everything before we did. ordered an appetizer it came with our food. only 2 pitas provided for entire meal and we ordered the vegetarian platter.
but.....
food is amazing. it is so authentic and is worth the price. it came out fast and was so good. if you're not a stickler on service, you have to come and try the food. the cooks deserve your service even if the wait staff does not.",4
"pizza maybe good, but delivery sucks.  and then when you call to check the status they say ""your on his list, just be soon"".  wth does that mean?  i asked for an eta. this happens everytime i get delivery and if this is anything like the other times, it will be cold.  very frustrated.....and you can't order online.  what pizza place doesn't offer that?",1
"always interested in experiencing different cultures, this was my first endeavor with ethiopian food.  went with a couple of gfs for lunch today and we all tried the lunch special sampler.  my sampler was comprised of alicha sega wat (beef), doro wat (chicken) and fosolia (string beans, carrots and onions) accompanied by injera bread.  we all found the injera bread to be ""interesting"" as we were expecting a different texture. with hindsight, we felt we should have ordered half rice and half injera as we were all trying things out for the first time.

other than the unexpected texture of the bread, the dishes were tasty (okay but not earth shattering).  service was okay (only saw one server for the entire restaurant).  my rating is 3.  i would come back if a friend wanted to try but i will not initiate a return just because.  of course, i encourage anyone to give them a try to see if it satisfies your taste buds.",3
"oh my god!!! worse airline in the whole universe, i don't know how these people live with themselves. they charged me additional $200 for booking and modifying my flight via phone without me knowing anything until i saw my receipt. they claim that i was informed so i can't disputed through their automated services. they also booked me a connecting flights when there was a nonstop direct flight available. i been in the airport sleeping on the carpet for the past 11 hours!!! they don't appreciate customers!! be smart and yelp before purchasing with them. what misery!! they didn't even wana refund me $83 instead said credit towards your next flight. honestly, keep my 83$!! i don't wana deal with their stupidity anymore so basically robbed me $233!! fu spirit!! u totally suck and people who work there have no morals",1
greatest job i have ever had at cleaning my home vents. true to price without trying to build on any extra cost. will use them again. highly recommended!,5
food was delicious!!! the mexican vegetables are amazingly good. the service is fantastic. we didn't wait long even for having 10 people on a busy saturday night. we loved this place and will definitely come back.,5
"eat, pretty simply put, how could i go wrong as i yelped up a something to eat this morning for some breakfast before returning home from vegas? 

i generally stay clear of the places that appear so sublime on yelp, but i was hungry and i was biting on the the yelp hook again for a relatively new place with a short track record. my gps in the rent-a-car told me this place didn't exist wtf was this some kind of yelp trick? i found it anyway a half dozen blocks down from the fremont street experience downtown, nestled under an old apartment complex.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=dmemu_sxchuw4eff8mxpog#1flxhcfngahklo7mepjucq  maybe 707 never existed before eat made her home here???

after feeding the meter across the street i crossed and hesitantly i walked into a nicely appointed, clean semi industrial, semi earthy space of a restaurant  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=dmemu_sxchuw4eff8mxpog#5hwjw33twikpbyqgxboraw  with only a few customers and was greeted by a tall dude (forget his name) with face full of jewelery, a punker hair-do and a dark gothish demeanor. he showed me to a table and got me some coffee right off. nice guy.

as i read the menu i knew i wasn't in kansas anymore toto, there were a bunch of menu choices that were out of the box and sounded very promising. http:\/\/eatdowntownlv.com\/breakfast\/

food ordered:
truffled egg sandwich two farm-fresh scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms, chives, feta, bacon and smashed potatoes

what i got:
truffled egg sandwich and some country style fried potatoes. the sammy was great, yummy thick sliced bacon atop a couple of fried eggs laced with shrooms and some chives and a kiss of feta cheese crumbles on a croissant roll. this sammy was good! and the taters were well seasoned and tasty as well. 4.5*****stars

the service was great too. plenty of refills, checked on me couple times too. had their s**t together.  4.5 **** stars

i also briefly met natalie young  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=dmemu_sxchuw4eff8mxpog#kz1wysqnzipx0gxnbqvwqa the chef \/ owner as she was kicking it with a few patrons at the table next to me. she seemed like a very nice and down to earth gal.

she explained that breakfast crowd for some unknown reason was always a bit slower but lunch and later times were always slammed full of customers. i can believe it if the lunch and dinner choices are anything like breakfast food. while a little pricey (still cheaper than the vegas strip restaurants) it's so worth it.

this place is as cool, hipster, and the food is as good as you are likely to find in a local las vegas eatery. its a local downtown eating establishment that's not on the beaten path when it comes to locale or food. this place is what most trendy la places wish they were  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eat-las-vegas-2?select=dmemu_sxchuw4eff8mxpog#lslxzcbjk6tow9weoeucsw hip with legit with great food and real atmosphere.

i gotta try the chicken fried steak next time it looked awesome!

i'll be back, next time in vegas!",4
"i'm no expert in getting pedicures, only my 4th time. tracy aparently does my wife's feet on occasion, wow, really took her time, did a fantastic job on my feet. being diabetic, it's verrrrry important to insure my feet are taken care of, i will come back here and ask for tracy and wait if i have to. i really appreciate her time and effort. thank you tracy!!!",5
"tried a couple tammie coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... unfortunately for them, i also sampled ollie cakes... no wonder ollie cakes, aka urban cookie, won cupcake wars and tammie coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake.

drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a brown velvet and lemon, and save saying you enjoyed tammie coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldn't know yummy if it bit them on the butt!

really, the tc cakes were just cakes... no flavor, no texture, dry... and i can't say how impressed i was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... as their products now do, at least to me.",1
"it's a crap shoot at this location. always short staffed. if the right cook is in the kitchen your food will be prepared right. and whatever you do, do not allow mya to be your server. she's horrible. no clue what customer service means. i'm watching all these other servers on their a game, but mya needs to be trained better.",1
"i've been going to emily for about a year.  she helped me immensely with leg and foot pain i had from running (used a variety of techniques including trigger point therapy and kinesio tex taping), as well as with general relaxation\/therapeutic massage.  she knows an incredible amount about the human body and is great at explaining all the intricate details if needed---names of ligaments and muscles, what's happening and why, ways to prevent future discomfort, etc.  she is incredibly patient, intuitive, and a calming presence.  i absolutely love her as a person and as a medical massage therapist.  several friends and acquaintances (athletes and non-athletes) have raved about her work as well.",5
"i was tagging along with my future sister in law.  she make an appt and told me to come with.  ok!  i love the boutique feel with the helpful staff.  they are very sweet not pushy plus they can custom any dress you see in the shop.  my future sister in law found her 1, 2, and 3 choices from there.  i know we will be back in june for her to narrow down the dresses.  what a great experience and awesome service they have.  make sure you make an appt, so you will get full attention.",5
i love this kohl's; it's never busy and there is always parking close.  it is the best kept secret at the holiday because everyone is shopping at the other stores.  i can never walk out with the one thing that i go there to get because i find all kinds of stuff to buy!,4
"took the family in on our way out to visit family in cg.  ordered a large regular crust with canadian bacon.  i was good with the taste.  pizza wasn't cut all the way through and with the bacon being underneath the cheese, it lead to a couple slices coming off the pan naked.  a bit of handy work and all was fine.  overall, decent.  $18 for a large one topping.",3
the owner was really helpful.  he answer all my questions that i had.  will come again. good customer services,5
"my friend had the veggie burger ..seasoning was a but to salty, but the veggie burger itself was was delicious! i had the bison burger in lettuce wrap...good size, cooked as i requested and delicious! and we both thought the french fries were wonderful, salt and all! of course, we made great beer selections...you will find your favorite beer too! once again we have straws in water and i wish they did not assume we want a straw. i am on a campaign of less plastic waste, and not using a straw is a small thing to do....less plastic waste ending up in our ocean. a positive note: music blasting by us was lowered. they did turn volume down so we're not blasted out of the place. 
outdoor seating available. good service.",4
"5 stars for amazing customer service, excellent selection on food and produce and for being opened 24\/7! please don't ever leave us!",5
these guys are always top notch helpful and polite.  they know the business and snow sports better than anyone around.  they always deliver goods and services as promised!!,5
"i have no idea.....how this place has gotten any sort of positive review on the food side. service was fine, it was quick and young gal was extremely polite and sweet. but my god that was way below average food. i got the beef and let me tell you, their dry shredded beef is not something that should represent the island name. not good based off that experience. now to be fair i'm sure the chicken is probably better but i'm afraid to go back. 

so like i said, service was good, food didn't match.",2
"hands down the worst customer service of any company i have ever dealt with. from the first call,  the lady who signed us up told us nothing but lies. she quoted us 40 dollars a month for internet with a. free month of prism for signing up. we got our first bill for 280 dollars with the full cost of prism,  and 80 dollars for the internet. we spoke to 6 different customer service reps trying to get it fixed.  some of them told us they would fix it and call us back,  then never did.  some of them told us they couldn't do anything for us,  and some of them just hung up on us. finally today i got through to the only knowledgeable person in their company apparently who fixed it in about 5 minutes.  i strongly recommend staying away from this company.",1
"as the ""duchess"" here i obviously visit pretty often and pretty recently. i have not had service issues others have mentioned. but what keeps me coming back is the smoothies. if you are not a fan of overly sweetened, fruity smoothies this is one of the few places for you. the green king matcha (270 cal in the small) is delicious, not at all bitter, and a satisfying meal replacement. children will appreciate the sweeter - but not syrupy - protein berry workout (around 300 cal).the oatmeal is tasty and comes with 2 fresh fruit toppings (or dried coconut, brown sugar, or honey). 

on hot days when i'm craving an ice cream milkshake i get the matcha green tea blast - no added sugar but it does have what tastes like slightly sweetened fro yo.

for sake of comparison, the one green tea smoothie at (i love) juicebar is over nine dollars. seriously, jamba juice is almost half the price.",4
"aisles & aisles of wine? check.
decent selection of craft and seasonal beers? check.
free wine tastings? check.
helpful employees? check.
special orders at no extra charge? check.
darn low prices? double check.

yes, it's missing the insane liquor selection tw&m gets to have in other states, but thats nc for you. (and the abc is right around the corner.) i never get through the store without at least one person asking if i need help, they can usually special order anything they don't have in store (if it's still available by the distributors, hardly anything out of season) at no extra charge, and you really cannot beat their prices.

i haven't sat through any of their wine or beer education classes, but i've heard good things about them, and the prices are usually pretty low to enroll. as for the beer selection, its pretty big. seasonal 6 packs are scattered throughout the store (and i've had some employees tell me they don't sell seasonal beers as singles, but they do. i'm pretty sure they just don't like to unless they've separated the pack themselves.) then there is a huge set of shelves divided between domestic\/craft and imports singles, and then a long aisle of 6packs and cases, also separated my domestic and imports (and a lot of brewer mixed\/sampler cases). they've upped their 750 bottle selection and craft selection in general over the past 6 months or so, it's rather impressive. you can also pick up growlers and assorted sizes of kegs. 

as for the wine, it's expansive and they most likely have what you're looking for in stock. (& also a good selection at each price point.) 

they are starting to increase the rate they send out coupons, so i'd definitely sign up for their email list.",4
"allegra at the brow bar is seriously skilled. i highly recommend going to her for anyone has unruly brows like i do. i searched for a long time to find someone who could tame these coyotes i call eyebrows, she's amazing! also consider getting a brow tint from her too, but be warned you'll love it so much you'll never be able to stop.",5
"i love this little bar. the food is really good. i don't really like wings and will only get them from here and greenhouse tavern. i get the cajun ones extra crispy. also their subs are the best. i get the smokin barrel and swap the meats for turkey. the bread is so good, it's a sloppy and huge sandwich, and totally worth the calories. 
i recommend signing up for the membership card if you are the kind of person that likes to be rewarded with free food. my only criticism would be the service can be a little slow, but that's not a big deal. now that i don't have stamper's, this is my favorite neighborhood bar.",4
"our pizza was good, but the service was slower than slow. our server disappeared for long periods of time.",2
finally made it to another yelp spot i wanted to try the barbecue was amazing the fried okra was to die for service was outstanding definitely a spot i'll try again,4
"came in on a friday night. self parking is a real beezy to find! you have to drive all the way to the back side of the pyramid close to the freeway. and there's no electric walkway so hopefully you don't have too much luggage! hahha 

they were not kidding when they promised us an amaz(e)ing experience here! i mean i guess it fits in with the theme and all that you want us to navigate this labyrinth of a lobby with not a single directory in sight but we're just trying to check in! i'm not trying to escape i promise! i at the end when we got to our hotel room 45 minutes after parking(new record!) i was expecting to have to defeat a mummy or something to get the room hahaha 

i guess overall hotel is decent enough for the price though the casino tried to rip me off when they colored me up. color me unimpressed! i might stay here again if they have a good deal but i may need a tour guide next time! hahaha",3
"i just checked out izakaya go after seeing some great reviews on yelp. i love ichiza even though it gets a bad rep: totally understandable. i figure this new place would be modern, clean, and familiar.

i've gone through the yelp photos many times so i new exactly what i wanted.

i came thursday night at 12:30am. it was empty. i was so happy. we were greeted promptly and basically had the entire staff to ourselves. the seating is cute with butt cushions that i really liked lol

i recently cut out meat as much as possible so i had a pretty vegetarian friendly meal with a friend.

we got french fries, oysters, cucumber roll, crispy rice, agedashi tofu, mushroom porridge, and the uni custard.

i have to say our meal was delicious. we just wanted something light but left ridiculously full. everything came out prompt, hot, the presentation was nice, and everything was cooked well. i enjoyed all of the above listed items. my one criticism is the dishes all seemed to be missing one little element that could make the food even better. 


maybe some fish eggs to top the uni custard? maybe something crunchy to top the mushroom porridge? maybe a house made aioli for the fries?

although small in size, the oysters were probably my favorite dish. they were fresh and seasoned so well with lemon and ponzu. 

i also really loved the uni custard. the texture was almost like silken tofu but it tasted so good! there was some shrimp in there and some other goodies. 

i really enjoyed my self as did my friend. we both left super full from for a total of $40. i can't wait to come back to get some more of the delicious oysters, super comforting mushroom porridge, and that special uni custard.

maybe it's because we had the place to ourselves, maybe it was because our servers only waited on us, or maybe we just got lucky. i hope to try the sushi burritos and ramen burger soon.

the free hot tea was nice.

i hope they add more desserts to their menu.",4
i'll say that it's clean and a lot of choices.  i only had a drink b\/c my husband wanted lunch while our grandkids were at the library-it's closest to them since we only had a few minutes.  good idea about the coca-cola drink machine.  i am not a lover of fast food but i was impressed w\/ the manager who was very friendly and helpful,3
"owners are really friendly and have great suggestions on flavor combinations. i always come out satisfied with whatever it is they suggest. when i come, i always just say ""something refreshing"" or ""something sweet"" and they just surprise me with something sooooo delicious!",5
"i am (was) a frequent customer of baton rouge both for personal and business occasions. i have been going to your restaurant since the first gta location opened in woodbridge. our office is on yong st north of finch in city of toronto and at least 12 times in any year we have either dinner or lunch at your restaurant at 5000 yonge st
last wednesday (june 10th) my assistant made a reservation for 5. she specifically requested a table as 5 men sitting a booth for a business meeting is not ideal.
when i arrived and requested my table the host became embarrassed and called the manager. after waiting at least 10 minutes the manager finally arrived. stalled for another 2 minutes then told us there were no tables only booths.
you can imagine that i was upset. my reservation clearly indicated a request for a table. if for some reason it was not available we should have been told when the reservation was made or if something occurred later (not sure what that could be) they had my phone number.
the manager made no effort to appease us.
we all left in our separate cars, paid for parking.
to rub salt into the wound and as an indication of you customer satisfaction program i called your head office yesterday. i told the receptionist that i had a complaint and without a comment put me into voice mail. i left a message but not surprising , received no call back",1
looks like they delete bad but true reviews!!  so posting again...i will never eat at this place again!  we ordered take out. i had the taco salad. i was shocked to find a live cock roach crawling put of it!  disgusting!  we immediately threw our entire dinners in a garbage bag and got them the heck out of the house!  when we called to complain they offered us a free meal on our next visit...really?!?!  don't think we will ever be going back there!  finally they refunded our money but didn't really care they are serving roaches in there dinners!  i am still in shock over this!!  and this was such a good place to get authentic mexican food.,1
"pretty good, but totally empty the night i went. the food was really tasty and the restaurant located very close to the jury's inn just round the corner. i would go again. i think i preferred the french place two doors down though.",4
"four stars for ambiance (spa pool, sauna, steam room, cool mist room).

three stars for massage.  massage was overpriced. got the ""body optimizer"" with a.j (male masseuse). 50 minutes\/$150.  i didn't feel like he worked on my back too much to relieve me of my painful knots but he did explain the reason for it. 

if i could round up, i would give 3.5.

"around the west towne mall area today and my stomach reminded me that it was time to eat. i really like chick fil a so in i go!

i ordered the classic combo - chicken sandwich, fries and medium soda. total was $6.49. it can't be bad, can it???

no, it can't. 

if you've frequented chick fil a you know their service is above average. i had a young man who was training help me and he did everything right. quick and efficient. soda was in front of me before i handed my money over. sat down after getting the necessary hot sauce (which is a must for me when eating here) and my food arrived within 60 seconds. 

the sandwiches are huge. this ain't no mcdonald's chicken sandwich trying to be fancy. it's a huge piece of chicken breast on a delicious bun. open it up, pour on the hot sauce, and i'm all set!

the fries are delicious although i'm not a fan of the super small ""break offs"" that you have to pick up like a claw machine game. small struggle but enough to make me think about...

the sandwich is the star here. moist, full of flavor and definitely satisfying. anyone who thinks these sandwiches are bad is either unamerican or have tastebud deficiency. it's really good and the price tag is fantastic. 

i only have two complaints about chick fil a. the breading, although delicious, always seems to be less crispy that desires. maybe that's a personal preference. the other issue is styrofoam cups. i hate styrofoam cups, and i'm not an environmental soldier, but i know the environment hates styrofoam cups also. small things in the grand scheme but big enough to keep the rating 4 stars instead of 5. 

service here is amazing. the food is fantastic. family friendly menu and prices. i think chick fil a is a great stop anytime of the day when your stomach reminds you its feeding time!!!",4
"please, please, please do your body good and get your piercing done at htc.  they are the best in arizona, i can guarantee you that.  (+ positive, - negative, -\/+ neutral).  

+ beautiful selection of jewelry.  they have bone, wood, glass...

+ they know what they're doing.  i actually had my tragus corrected here because the last guy who did it (tattoo shop, of course) did it wrong.

-\/+ i have yet to decide what i think of their customer service.  ninety-nine percent of the time they're very helpful, understanding and polite.  once, however, i thought one guy was going to have a fit because i took my gauges out.  how was i supposed to know that was unhealthy practice?  maybe he was just having a bad day...

+ ask them anything.  no question is too dumb, believe me, i've asked plenty of them.",5
decent.    no complaints.  no eggs still. but hopefully they will figure it out soon.   can't give sweet tomatoes 5 stars but it's not bad for a salad bar.,4
where do i start 1. got reservation at hotels tonight (which was 20 dollars more than booking through hotel).    the hotel didn't have our reservation.   they made us wait to contact hotels tonight.   i offered to pay for room and when they figured it out with hotels tonight to just refund me they refused. 2.   room service: asked for pitcher of water with dinner. they brought two cups.  we're supposed to have complementary water but only 2 mini bottles in fridge. and no minibar.  3. bags were supposed to be brought up.   took twice the amount of time.  magically appeared after i called complaining 4.  sheets are stained and gross.    5. room smells like mildew  they said they upgraded us.  not sure of the upgrade.  next time i'll upgrade to excalibur. 6. we were supposed to have late checkout.   they checked us out at normal time.  when i called to ask what was going on they just said sorry.   the hotel has said sorry enough.   we have a trip planned in april to stay here.  we will stay in elsewhere.,1

"my favourite, although i will have to consider my lunch time options now that their lunch specials have gone up by a dollar, and their competition has not upped their prices.

but i just love it here. complimentary soup and ice cream, the best salad dressing in the world, big portions, and cheap prices. also, they take reservations, so it makes it a good party place for me.",5
desiree is amazing! i moved here from sf and the costumer service is above and beyond. her attention to detail has been a blessing. best property manager i have ever dealt with! it will be hard to move (if i have too) knowing the security and care she shows for her clients. i wish every business operated this way. big thumbs up!!!,5
"this is a very nice library.  there is a beautiful marble stair case that winds itself up between the two floors.  there is parking both in the front and the back.  if you park in the front you will enter on the first floor where you can find the children's area.  if you park in the back you will enter on the top floor where you will find adult fiction and non-fiction.  this is nice if you don't want to climb the staircase ;) - btw, there is an elevator that goes to the 2nd floor if you need it.  also on the 2nd floor there is a little store where you can buy used books and magazines.  they also have coffee and hot chocolate and snacks.  there are plenty of computers to use if you need one, they also have free wifi.  there are also many desks\/tables to sit and do work.  they have a nice area cordoned off that is carpeted and has comfortable chairs and a fireplace.  i also like that they have the option of self-checkout.  this way i don't have to wait for someone to wait on me if i'm in a hurry.  be sure to check out their monthly flyer.  they are always offering classes that are computer, exercise, reading related and more!  many of these classes are even free!",4
"i just picked up lunch for my coworkers and they cant stop raving about how good the food was!  everyone is already talking about going back.  i had the ""man"" salad and it was amazing.  packed with good protein and gluten free, not to mention so fresh and tasty!  i'll have plenty of energy for a good workout after work and no stomachache from lactose or gluten.  plus, the employees were friendly and upbeat in spite of the lunch rush.  yes, the drive thru line was a little long, but completely worth it.  great job, d'lish!  i'm so happy to find a fast, healthy local restaurant.",5
"i would come here for just the sweet rolls & cinnamon butter! i love how they come right out when you're seated. 

i got the chopped steak aka the road kill. it was topped with mushrooms, onions, cheese & i got a side of brown gravy to top it off with. the meat was juicy & cooked perfectly! it went really well with the brown gravy. i normally get the chopped steak from brown derby roadhouse but, this chopped steak is so much better than brown derby's. the chopped steak came with 2 sides so, i got the rice & sweet potato. the rice was mushy & tasted off & the sweet potato was also very mushy. i could of skipped both of the sides.

i guess if you come in from open til 6 monday-friday's, you can get this meal & other meals for only $8.99 which is a really nice deal.",4
"glad to see that the big burrito restaurants are alive and well in pittsburgh, and dinner tonight was my first time in awhile at one of their establishments.

bit of a complex review.  my biggest gripe with casbah is that it's casbah mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but i don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic mediterranean dishes.  one lamb dish (not overly mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of mediterranean cuisine.  even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that i've seen in a typical mediterranean joint.  i think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking mediterranean cuisine.

we sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  as for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. so lots of food!  all was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.

lots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following.",3
"my boyfriend found this hidden gem.  he highly recommended it to me.  i went in there the service was personable, and extremely reasonable.  i had several work jackets pressed and ready to go within a day turnaround.  not to mention their alterations rock! i brought in over 8 pair of slacks\/jeans to have hemmed and altered.  i pinned them myself and turned them in.  the charge for them to reconstruct these work pants and jeans was amazing and in my budget! plus they came back pressed and dry cleaned!  i would highly recommend them with any sort of cleaning \/ alteration they are fabulous.",5
it's a nice place to go to if you're not looking for anything fancy or too expensive. they have really good food and offer great service. the waiters are very attentive and make sure you have everything you need. the eggs beni are definitely my go too but honestly everything is very tasty. their coffee also isn't bad. nice environment.,4
"a good place for eggs, pancakes and such for breakfast. also, they are quick with the coffee and leave the whole pot there, which is key for me on many a morning. the other great thing is that while this place gets packed on the weekends, it moves people in and out quickly, so you never wait that long. the menu is huge and they allow substitutions, so it is good when you have friends, family or picky eaters in town.",3
"wow!  great night at pei wei, our favorite restaurant in the entire metrolina area.  we had been overseas for a few weeks, and we dreamed of returning to pei wei to enjoy some sweet and sour chicken, plus a giant dr. pepper from the coca cola freedom machine.  within three hours of landing back in charlotte, we were at pei wei, with our sweet and sour chicken ordered.  however, the freedom machine was out of dr. pepper.  out of dr. pepper!  but, to the rescue came pei wei's chris.  he ran out to the store next door with some pei wei cash in hand, and he brought us back an entire two liter bottle of cold dr. pepper!  we were so surprised, so glad to see the dr. pepper in chris' hands.  unbelievable customer service.  if we could give chris and the entire team a million stars, we would!  thanks for making our return to the usa great!",5

i love this place. portions are great and flavors are amazing. the menu options all sound amazing and i plan to try most of it! i've had the traditional gyro and the roasted lamb! so good! i also had to try the aphrodite cheesecake that's like two desserts in one due to the baklava crust,5
i have been wanting to try st. francis and i was not disappointed.  i loved the eggs benedict and the cute potatoes on the side were fabulous!  the atmosphere and volume of the restaurant were great which really added to the dinning experience.  i'll be back....,5
"nice, clean, and pretty. i like that it's away from everything and especially the madness of the las vegas strip. the movie theater (regal cinemas) is nice and i like the addition of the fan-favorite yard house restaurant. this is my choice of visit when deciding on a casual night of a movie or outing. the property is overall really nice and as long as they keep offering great establishments within, it's definitely worth a visit.",4
"i agree with linda and nathan.

there were some aspects of this resort that are so amazing.

but the missing 1 star is because the lobby staff \/ customer service could use improvement.

we came as a group and had multiple rooms.

waiting until customers post 1 star reviews before responding is poor strategy.",4

"we have been here probably 25 times, mostly lunch with some dinners.  our favorite spot for great rice bowls and sushi rolls.  i haven't ordered a salad, but they look good.  love the customizable bowl menu with light or dark chicken, beef, salmon, tofu, fresh vegetables (you select), and many sauce options.  great sushi rolls are made fresh and nicely presented with choice of 4 or 8-pieces.  fountain drinks include a variety of great iced teas.  service has been wonderful each visit so far.",5
"i've been here three times with my parents and it's turned into one of our new favorite restaurants! i've tried three of the salads, the grapes and gorgonzola and the antipasto were my favorites however, i wasn't really a fan of the grilled vegetable salad. my parents always get a pizza and i'm not sure which ones they have gotten but they're always really good! i've also gotten the meatballs as an appetizer and they were good but not anything too special. the staff is very friendly and accommodating, they brought my salad just as i had asked for it. overall, i haven't had a bad experience at this restaurant and the food is awesome!",4
"always been fan of bachi burger so hearing about this newer version but still the same owners! excited! bookmarked for sometime just never got around to it. the irony is bachi hlk is literally five minus from my house. i never really noticed it. yay its off busy street rainbow but not looking you never think about tit. i found the perfect excuse check it off bookmark. recovery meal! not only recovery meal (the best meal of the day) with my favorite yelper\/triathlon warriors in my life. suzy h and terri r. we hit bachi hlk for lunch after solid swim workout in the pool. terri been here before the rest of  us first timers. my first impressions was really really nice interior decor of healthy restaurant. not that breakfast joint or lunch spots lack class. bright earth tone color scheme all around so walking in kind of brightens your day. lol! i find it relaxing. it refreshing change from the darker look of the bachi burgers. special boards on the back wall when you walk in. so always keep eye out for it and see if anything jumps at you.

the food i started with order of beignets. i would say it was ok. i liked the outside was crispy, nice coating of power sugar, and one of the thing about classic beignet get your fingers sugar coated with every bite. it lacked is the inside was moist but little dense and just not fluffy or light true beignets. the sauce the strawberry guava got nothing but rave things about. i could take bottle of that home for all thing toasted nice spread on top. the other two sauces felt was ok. overall tried the beignet by itself then with the sauces. nothing wow about it. entree ordered the breakfast sandwich.i always harp sandwich is only as good as the bread. the ciabatta bread was on point!!!! it had the nice crust and moist\/hot on the inside. love the fact the bacon was cooked crispy perfection not greasy. add the eggs any style you want its literally the perfect breakfast of champions all wrapped up in sandwich. 

best part about eating with yelpers is sharing is caring. i fortunate enough too try some of the banana bread. i thought was ok. not sure the muffins tried but nothing that made lasting impact for me. pastry fell short but maybe ordered or tried the wrong ones.

the service was excellent. i am fan of new version of bachi. more then thrilled that its so close my house. it nice diverse menu of breakfast items, lunch, and not all the things are healthy on the menu. so if want substance you can find it here at bachi hlk. i will be coming back.",4

it wasn't worth our time. 
we probably wouldn't pay
much more than a dime. (that's being generous)

magic and cirque,
sounds like lots of fun
even the motorcycles
impressed us quite a ton. 

little did we know
the front was the best part; 
don't waste any money, 
run away, if you're smart!

or just disappear
since that's all he really knows
we should have taken a hint
from all the empty rows.

half the time there,
we saw videos from his past;
him growing as a child
which did not go by that fast.

then he did perform
some magic that impressed me
but oops, it's mostly clips
from youtube and tv.

but where is all the cirque?
and why so much money? 
tasteless and too cheesy;
not even all that funny.

he mostly ends up screaming;
seeming intense but was lame.
cirque, please note to oust this show! 
it gives you a bad name!",1
"i have tried multiple salons in charlotte and always come back to vintage nails. they are the only salon i've ever been to where all the employees take their time and are meticulous every time. the service is consistently fantastic and the staff is always very welcoming, and i leave feeling like i've been treated like i'm the only customer there no matter how busy they are. and the best part is that they're affordable. highly recommend trying vintage nail bar.  

ps attached photos of my most recent gel mani and pedi.",5
"this place looks great from the outside, has a nice big patio and has an excellent location at the corner of markham and bloor.  the staff have always been super friendly and are excellent in terms of service.

then there's the negatives.  rocco's is kind of dirty.  i've seen plenty of fruit flies hanging around tables on more than one occasion.  but i usually put that aside, telling myself that it's a nice place and the food will make up for it.

unfortunately, this is usually not the case.  the food is very bland.  maybe it's me, but i don't think so.  prices aren't impressive either.  even if the food was good, i'd still consider it overpriced.  considering it's not that great, it's very overpriced.

rocco's is a nice place to sit, but not a nice place to eat.",2
"this place is absolutely fantastic! i havent been to the actual business as i have only ordered via ubereats but this is my cheat meal go to! and its supporting a family run business on top of it, sincerely great business and the one issue that popped up was met with a phone call and great service to get it sorted. food is always consistantly great as well.",5
"i'll start this review by saying we did two rooms in one night (hostage and professor) we had a blast in the hostage room and had we stopped there this would be a 5 star review. we chose to do the most difficult room second and the reason for my frustration does not stem from the fact that we were unable to complete the room, but once our time was up and a staff member came into the room to show us what we were doing wrong he realized we in fact didn't miss a step or do anything wrong but the piece of equipment that we couldn't get past was broken! he turned to us and said ""oh yeah, you were right... this is what it should have done"" and after tinkering with it for a few minutes he got it to function correctly. i was prepared for the fact that this room may be too difficult for us to complete (2 adults and 2 kids) but i was really taken back that on top of an already amazing challenge we were beat before we started.",3
"my boyfriend got me 6 cupcakes on sunday morning, and i finally got around to trying one friday night. (am i going to die now?) after popping  my red velvet cupcake in the microwave for 15 seconds, i had the best cupcake i've ever had in my life!! i could probably down a dozen of these. can't  comment on service or any other flavors, but that one cupcake gets 5 stars from me!",5
"two and a half stars.  it's nice to see that this wendy's is still open.  when i lived in greenfield, my friends and i would come here a couple of times a month.  i've always liked wendy's better than mcdonald's or burger king--but that ain't sayin' much.   i'd always order off the value menu because i liked a baked potato and butter (instead of fries) and a side salad with my burger.  

i've only been back here on rare occasion since i got married, but when i do, i still like the value menu.",2
"here is a great, relaxed kensington cafe that  doesn't require dreadlocks to enjoy. and here i was thinking they'd become extinct (relaxed cafes, not dreadlocks). arrived in the dwindling minutes of the am to a bustling crowd but still managed to get a seat at the window on one of the very cool vintage stools. the place has an earthy feel, but not in an incense and drum circle kind of way. splash boards are an attractive found wood and the corner location allows for plenty of light. i had the chicken sandwich which was fresh and delicious, just the right amount of avocado and sauce to make it hearty but not sloppy. but the real thumbs up is for the coffee which i typically don't care that much about. quickly made and not burnt immediately sets unwind apart from most cafes, but the balance with the properly frothed milk was what really made my tongue do the happy dance.

it's unlikely to be on the way to where you're going, as it's a bit hidden away, but if you do stumble upon it, you're in for a treat.",4
"it's getting downgraded and fast - 2 stars.

listen people, we understand that times are tough - their tough on us too. but if you're going to cut back on your happy-hour offerings, don't use the lame excuse that it because there were too many drunks making trouble.

no more $10 yard beer specials and who knows what else was lost in this recent management decision.

"great pizza at a great price. 800 degrees was one of only a couple truly spontaneous dining experiences my wife and i had during our visit to vegas. our pizzas were very cheap when compared to pretty much everything we ate on the strip. it was great pizza with a thin crust, very fresh sauce and toppings, and a fair bit of char on the crust.",5

"ordered the fish and chips, side of onion rings, side of zucchini, and a salad. it was really bad. picked it up - food was waiting when i got there. 15 minute drive from my house. got the food back to the house - it was cold and soggy - not one thing was crunchy.  i even put a special note on every item asking for crunchy - on the fries i asked for extra crunchy! they totally ignored all of it. 

worst fries ever - soft and bad flavor. fish was not only not crispy, but also not particularly tender. i noticed a few hard spots - sign of cooking it incorrectly. very disappointing. :(",1
"i love it here ! i stayed for a week, rooms are big and  clean, plenty restaurants to choose from if you're hungry. there's also the night club to check out also.",5

really!? you are going to charge 4 girls at 3am!? we were asked to pay $30 each to get in for 1 hour. only to get in and see there was no one there! if you wanted to you could probably squeeze whoever was left into the 2nd or 3rd floor and still have plenty of room to move. old decor and everything for a vegas club.,1

hubby and grandson who is 9 ordered the motley q bbq sandwich to share and it was still yummy. i had the chili topped with cornbread and it was wonderful!! daughter had turkey burger and she said it was very tasty! we had the churros...again delicious..shared the fried ice cream boulder sundae which is a big ball of ice cream rolled in frosted flakes..deep fried ...served on a bed of shredded coconut..on the side to do your own thing is chocolate syrup, caramel, peanut butter and banana, strawberries, pineapple and honey. my daughter said she would eat it everyday at every meal it was so good!!

"absolutely crap! drenched in heavy amount of oil, very expensive, not worth it, as for the rest of the menu no different still crap! highly not recommend.",1
had an awesome time this week at the escape adventure. the room we did was alice in wonderland themed. it was beautiful and so much fun. we made it too the last clue and for almost all of us it was our first time. even though we weren't successful we had a great time still and i can't wait to come back.,5
"i have found that the quality of the food at many of the mexican restaurants tends to vary depending on who is cooking that day and on what time of the day you come in for your meal.  some time the longer the sauce has simmered the better it is.

i have never been disappointed with the food at this manuel's.  salsa is always great and the meal is always tasty.  i also consider their prices to be reasonable.  i used to love macayo's when i first got to the valley, but they have gone downhill.  they seem to be too cost conscious.  someone also mentioned top shelf as being better.  i found that to be totally bland.  

i pretty much like all the manuel's, with the exception of the one over around bell and 12th ave.  but, maybe i just had a few bad days there.",4

"i really liked this place. the service was great! the food was creative and artful. we ordered the salmon, my husband said that it was a little boring but i really enjoyed it. the macaroni waffle was delicious and the cremè brûlée doughnuts were amazing!",5
"tastiest broth in town! 
very authentic and aromatic! instant orgasm of the senses as the taste fills your mouth while the vapors of steamy aromatic spices of all that's great  ventilates up your nose!   
the best pho you will ever have! cooked in the hottest and most well seasoned wok in town! 
you will be emotional when you start seeing the bottom of the bowl! all good things must come to a end they say!...... i'm fat so i  usually just order another!

 i've  been to almost every vietnamese restaurant in the valley since 1999 and this place is number one! no matter what you order its the best! i have been eating here since they opened in 2001. i was lucky and blessed enough to almost live behind it a few years while i was a student at pima medical institute.
 we would eat there twice a day often... lunch and dinner. i even use to sneak a meal in before my wife got home.... not because i was fat but because she was tired of the same thing everyday and enjoyed my cooking! 

i have brought other pho connoisseurs here that were visiting me from san diego, hilo hawaii , la, las vegas, cleveland, and the east coast and all agree it's the some of best!  
the spring rolls and beef rolls are by far the freshest and most tasty you will ever eat. the only thing you will not find here is banh mi(sandwiches). they stopped making them about 6 years ago. i think that someone put pressure on them to stop selling them since their is  well know vietnamese sandwich shop from la that opened up not to far away (lee's) about the time they stopped making them! such a shame because they were the best! makes me wonder!

the number 9 is my favorite! rare beef with well cooked beef. 
the stew is mazing but not always available. 
their pork chop with baked egg and shredded pork is amazing! 
the imperial rolls outstanding and crunchy! 
freshest spring rolls in town with the best peanut sauce around! 
house fried rice is full of treasures!

not the nicest building... it originally was a taco bell in the 80s then some dumpy shitty greasy strange mix sorry excuse for asian food before these brilliant straight off the boat beautiful young vietnamese family turned it into heaven! 
so though its a old run down restaurant with layer after layer of paint and cracked windows its some of the best food you will ever eat and so darn cheap you can feed the family even in this economy!

vietnamese coffee. hot and iced.
thai tea with or without boba.
salted lemonade and sodas.

the water is not the best! though it's filtered it still taste like it came from canals! your welcome to bring in your own! 

the small kitchen and tiny beat down walk-in forces them to use fresh ingredients daily!

since it's located across from mesa community college it can be packed during lunch time fall and spring semesters! the seating is always limited anyhow to around 12 tables... only two tables can seat a party of 6 .most of the tables can seat 2-4 only! 

don't plan on using the restrooms here since they usually are locked or out of order do to vandalism since they are located in the back of the building! 

plenty of parking at night but can be tight in mid week during lunch. 

don't forget to tip them well since they work their asses off 7 days  week only taking vacation every few years!  

if i ever it the lottery i'm going to hire them to be my personal chefs! 
one of the worst things in my life to happen was becoming disabled and losing everything forcing me to move away! the disability part is ok as well as the losing everything i worked for  but the 200 miles distance from me to pho nhat has been depressing! we really do miss it and only get to eat here few times a year now! we have even rented a car and got a room to just eat here for lunch then have dinner at blue adobe then next day on way home have pho again! it's that effing good!

enjoy! i hope to see you there soon!",5
"i'm so happy we found this place on our trip to montreal, it was the best brunch i've ever had.  unless you get there early expect to wait at least an hour to get in but it is worth the wait.  the servers are super nice, the place looks awesome and its one of the few places where the bathrooms are worthy of a selfie.",5
"lets first start off with , we eat mexican food 4 times a week , and the name of this place has nothing to do with mexican , should have guessed .
this place is cute, severs are good, chips are good, hot sauce is good, but not chucky..
all that said the food looked good delivered , we all bite in and wow,no taste, blaned , , the cheese enchiladas was so bad couldnt eat them , cheese was melted , but the homemade wrappers under coked, black bean tasted like they opened a can of black beans and poured on the plate, not drained, no spicy, my husband refired beans the same way . we all three couldnt eat our meals , such a disappointment .
i guess thats why happy hour is from 11am-7pm

my feelings are never go in unless your thirsty , not hungery. .
so giving it a 1star is pushing it , and thats chips",1
"for the price their ayce shabu shabu is pretty good. if you like flavor get the soy sauce based broth, the other one is a little bland. i think there was 3 different ayce meat choices. their sauces were ok. the service was attentive and the sliced meat was served just as quickly as it was being eaten. there are better shabu shabu places but for the value, swish is good.",3
"since there is no possible way to say this lightly, i will be straight up and let you know what i thought of this place. if you are coming here and you're claustrophobic and you have to wait for a table, this is not a place for you to be. the staff is friendly, but some of the staff is not so friendly. 

here's the reason i'm giving this such a low rating, we came here on a monday morning looking to have breakfast before our flight. we made sure to give plenty of time so we were here by 10 in the morning which our flight wasn't until two in the afternoon plenty of time to make sure we have our meal without rushing. we have to wait 20 minutes for a table on a monday morning, the lobby which there is none so we waited outside until our names were called. we were sat at our table, along with three other tables that were sat around us at the exact same time. it took our waiter 15 minutes just to come and say hi and ask if we want to drinks. by the time our drinks came back which was another 10 minutes, we were ready to place our order which we did. if you minutes went by, and then we started to notice the tables that sat down after us headstart to receive their meals. we asked the waiter which we finally got his attention after 15 minutes of trying to flag somebody down. he said he would return, of course he did not. i then asked to speak to a manager which promptly a manager did show up. he checked on our meals which we discovered at that time where never placed, at that time it was realize we have been there for almost an hour with no food one drink and a lot of frustration. i have always wanted to come to a cracker barrel, but now no i will never return to one due to the lack of service i received at this location. i am sure other locations are much better and you give better service, but i will not take that opportunity to find out due to the lack of service from the staff here at this location.

on a sidenote yes the manager was willing to give us a free meal which i was not willing to take because i do not want to wait anymore time for a meal to arrive.",1

"about a week ago i had the pleasure of ordering pick up from this establishment! i read the reviews on yelp so i had several ideas on what was recommended by others to have. some reviews weren't great but we all have an off night! i have to say my expectations weren't too high considering some of reviews. i was very happily surprised by the quality of the food, portions and overall the flavor of the food! when i ordered over the phone they were polite and helpful even though they were closing in 45 minutes when i ordered. when i picked up my order it was ready and still nice hot!! once home i was impressed with the flavor of the sauces, amount of meat in the portions and freshness of the veggies! great job guys!! we will be ordering for pick up again!",5
"great contracted installers, but the company rep was not. installers said to do one thing for my carpet insert, he said to do another, but they were scared to say anything to contradict him. they were right, he was wrong, and now every time i see the carpet insert i'm get angry thinking about it. i would never recommend the company, and just hope a review will help someone else avoid the same issues.",1
"let start by saying i have not given any place a 1 star, i gave this place 1 star because i have to, there is nothing less than a *.

we had a dis-pleasure of going to this place in mid october, i had been here once before and did not think much of the place back than.

this is a place which mostly offers indian\/pakistani, hakka chinese & middle eastern food.

you enter into a restaurant and you say wow this is a really nice restaurant (caution don't be fooled). we were seated glasses on the table were mostly clean but one had a dried lipstick stain on it.

now for the food, very tasteless and blend, seemed dishes were cooked long time ago so were not fresh nothing looked fresh with the exception of fried stuff and chinese rice.

they had problem keeping the serving plates stocked, they kept on running out of food and people had to make several trips to get a one serving (this is the same problem we encountered when we went last time). when i complained i was told that everyone is going at the same time and people should be behave and give some time let others get what they want let us fill up and then others should go (this is what i got out of their logic and told them that this is a buffet and they should be prepared for this situation)

this place in my opinion is not good at all, save you money go to subway and enjoy your food.",1
"i got the farmhouse burger and the chipotle hash. first off, the wait took 20 minutes on a friday at 1pm. then i was served a really dry beef patty. it was obviously previously frozen, but man the dryness was unbearable. it was like biting into sand, not pleasant. now for the hash, it tasted good but i was expecting something other than plain potatoes topped with a chipotle sauce for 2.50$. i have to say i'm pretty disappointed in this place and i am far from picky.",2
"i had a great experiance at tire works.  they explained everything in detail what i needed and also told me the most important repair and repairs that could wait.  being a woman and some car repairs are complicated, they showed me the parts that were needed the time it would take to get them done and cost.  i live close and did not have a ride home since it was going to take some time (but was done the same day) i was offered a ride by one of the workers.  hard to find that kind of service in a big town.  i love the small town, friendly feel at tire works.   it will be my new auto shop!!  thank you chris and art.",4
"i really liked the setting and feel of selwyn.  think of an old grungy irish bar with an awesome patio.  during football this place gets packed and the people that come here are usually a fun group. as a bar this place is great to catch a beer, you don't have to dress up, and the patio is perfect.   it goes downhill though.

we first got our wings ( frozen) that were actually cooked very well.  there are a bunch of sauces to choose from so they were suprisingly very good.  i had the pizza and my friend had a sandwich.  he hated his sandwich, which is suprising because he will eat anything.  my pizza was just ok.  the service took forever and our appetizer and food came out at the same time ( a huge pet peeve of mine).  

the only reason i would come back is for drinking beer outside on the patio.",3
"bought a groupon for this place simply due to the location and the fact that i had never heard of them before. i wasn't expecting much (the cheesy name and small location made me think it was going to be a generic burger joint). my visit has turned me into a believer.

it's a quaint little establishment that basically looks like an upscale fast food joint with a bar (i believe this place used to be d martini's).

i had a cameron's cream ale (oakville brewery that i hadn't seen on tap anywhere else) and the beef tacos and my gf had the chicken burrito. we also shared an order of the cassava fries. everything was delicious and authentic (the tacos were on par with what you'd get at upscale mexican joints like milagro), service was great, the fresh sauces were amazing, and the best part - the prices were incredible. even without the groupon, our meal would have been $25. for a pint of craft beer and two delicious meals i can't complain.

i will definitely be back, i just hope that they shape up their marketing and drum up business so that they stay open. i never would have known this place existed if it wasn't for the groupon.",5
"this is the second time i've been here and the damn restaurant is closed during open hours. i drive from the west valley, 30 miles to try their pastries since they made such a deal about them! 

i'm not willing to sacrifice time, energy or money on this crap show of a business. it gives scottsdale eateries a bad name.",1
"you don't get to take chicken strips from the lunch menu, put them on a very average waffle and call it chicken and waffles!!!!  thesse were by far the worst chicken and waffles i've ever had.  they weren't even good chicken strips.  please please please go find someone's grandmother's fried chicken recipe and start over again.  you should immediately take these things off your menu.  they were horrible!!!!

wow!  ok!  now that i've got that out of my system, the grand lux cafe has always been a ""go to"" spot whenever we've stayed at the venetian.  it's the affordable dining establishment.  overall the food has always been pretty good and they're open 24 hours.  i'm sure i'll stumble in again some time.......",2

"i came here for a brunch menu item, not realizing brunch was only on the weekends. so i asked the waitress to to pick for me. she chose the brisket burger. and it's literally the best burger i've ever eaten. i travel a lot for work, and have had a lot of burgers, and this was the best! bun was perfect texture, the taste was insanely good! if you like burgers, you have to have the brisquette!  i waited a little longer than i would have expect for the traffic, but it was completely worth it. service is great too!",5
"food is usually on par here, and this was our 4th time dining here. our server named chris was in ""a hurry"", demonstrated poor communication, and barely attended to us during my wife's birthday dinner, so we were a bit disappointed. he made an annual special occasion a subpar experience for us. 

when he finally took the time to visit us and requested for our order, he did not recommend any wine to us either. neither did he ask ""are you guys celebrating anything special?"" 

so, usually we receive good service here and we go out of our way to travel to pomo, but they (owners and management) truly need to filter out the wait staff that is all about ""making money"", doing more with less and make it more about truly serving customers in a timely way with quality service.

problem we experienced: after he visited us after 20-25 mins of waiting for him to take the order, there
was a delay after this to deliver the wood fired pizza to the table because he held the order,
since the lasagna we ordered took longer to prepare- at least that was the excuse we heard. however, he did not communicate it to us in this way prior to taking order, and we could have opted to have the pizza first which arrived cold at our table! nice job, pomo!!! 

but, pomo- please do yourselves a favor and augment your wait staff and retrain these
young waiters who have no idea how\/when food is prepared and to take time out to serve and understand your customer's needs.",2
very honest!  i went in to have my wedding band checked for loose \/ worn prongs.  the repair gentleman looked it over & said everything was great.  he then cleaned it for me and told me to have a good day.  no charge!  it was a good day!   :),5

"exactly what you expect in vegas, lots of white leather, shiney sliver chandeliers, black and dark from the waist down that you can't see two steps ahead of yourself. i think vegas is known for this cheesy excessive mirrors and a few levels of floors to dance and have vip tables on. this is that club, by the end of the night you will be dripping sweat, wasted, and have danced your ass off. those in my opinion are the most important bullet points in a successful club experience. bottle service girl was sweet and mixed shots\/drinks for us. and there was enough security to feel very accessible if you had any problems or questions.

*the main beef i had was the music\/sound system was ridiculously loud, you had to yell to talk to anybody right next to you. if you want to talk to anybody out of their face good luck. my ears were ringing the entire night even after we left the club. the next day i felt totally deaf then it came back slowly. i'm wearing earplugs if i go to pure again. seriously. 
i take off one star what's above and for the so-so dj, play something current if we are spending thousands of dollars to dance play something that the average club age person will relate to. (this is only valid for the night i attended pure and could be totally different night to night.) i was there friday - june 5th, 2009.

*i take off the second star for the bathroom policy with one person in a stall. that alone is just sorta creepy that the bathroom workers are more like yard duties at lunch time at a middle school than people who should be making sure you're having a pleasant club experience.

wouldn't mind going again...",3
"i'm a fan because i just loooove the bruschetta. love it. the bruschetta here is good. it's reliable (although i do think that the campbell location tastes better.... not sure why) and have you tried the tomato jam?!?!?!? try it. just do it. mmmmmm!

yes, it's pricey, but most of these trendy spots tend to be. 
the last time i came, we ordered the plate and the salumi as starters. the salumi is good, but hello, what a stingy little plate! i think 3 little slices of bread, 3 slices of salumi, one little glob of burrata, and 1 baby roasted tomato cut up.... there were 6 of us. sigh. the plate is good, but again, skimpy! i had ordered the same plate about a month prior and it was not that pathetic.

$5 mimosas always please everyone. and wine is $5 a glass every day from 11-5pm. 

anyways, as always, the bruschetta pleased the masses. and i will come back, when i have visitors. or when i get another gift card.",4
"worst car rental experience ever!!

i rented a car here through hotwire on 12\/27. they made us wait over two hours for our car. then they said if we wanted a car right away, we would have to pay an additional $16 per day for a higher performance vehicle. they should have given us the higher performance vehicle with no extra charge, since they dropped the ball!

i also needed to rent the car for an additional day and they said it would cost me $150 for just one day! the customer service is terrible at this hertz and the management is totally unethical, to say the least. i called hertz's customer service after the fact and all they could do was offer me $25 back.

i will never rent from hertz again! ever! use anybody but hertz. and at this location there are like 10 other choices you have, so avoid them like the plague!",1

"disappointing!!!
i went here this morning after school to get two sets of their moni siopao and let me tell you, it was the worst decision of my siopao life!! omg!! i came home and bit my siopao, all i got in my mouth was a bunch of bread. so i bite again only, bread. and again, guess what i found, bread!!! i was almost done with my sipao when i found the cute little teaspoon amount of mean they call ""asado"". so disappointing!! i was so upset, i sliced 3 more of the remaining siopao, and they are all the same. all bread with a teaspoon of filling!! bad quality! 

bottom line, do not buy siopao from them. it's all bread. both their big siopaos and mini siopaos are disappointing. just buy them from chowking if you like.",1
i'm pretty new to running and was originally going to buy shoes based on an online suggestion from runner's world but decided to try here first and i'm very glad i did. his suggestion was a different type of shoe than what was suggested online. he gave me three different brands to try after watching my gait. i chose what was most comfortable based on his suggestions and after my first run in them i feel great!,5

"i want to like this shop, i really do buttttt.....! i dropped my bass off to get it set-up. walk in in see this nice old lady with no bra on and her tats just flopping every which way. i told her i wanted it set up and the first thing she says is set ups are 65. uhhh its 65 for their complete one and 35 for basic ( i checked the website before i went in) the upsell for the gig was a lil irky. so they said it was about a 5-7 day wait. i asked for it to be a rush which is 35 bucks more and was told it would be ready in 2 days. 2 days come and go and i call them on the 3rd asking about my instrument. "" uhh ohh let me check  yeah its done, we called you once but your number was disconnected"" i have had the same number for the last 7 years and sprint is so kind they debit my checking account automatically, so no my phone was no off. i go in and pick it up and still get hit with the rush fee even though they didn't deliver",1
"zero stars!!!!!

do not come here save your self the headache. yes it's cheap but it's not worth it!!!! your eye brows will literally look like line on your face!!!!!! especially one employee in particular she's horrible!!!! every-time without fail i see someone always complaining about her. thank god i never got her till now. she an older lady short hair (with a boy hair cut) we will call her bull dagger she has a resting bit** face!! i mean you can't miss her!!!! first off this is not my first time here this is like my 10th time here. this lady usually does eyebrows and facial waxing upon observation. there's two ladies' that do this though the other lady has long gray hair which is very nice. so don't get them mix up. anyway, she put too much wax like a thick layer usually they put a thin layer to avoid putting off access hair!! i mean come on people common since. and after she put the wax on my eyebrow she put the strip on and smooth's it out. so obviously it had lots of access wax. which as you could image it went everywhere. on the cheek on the temple area almost in my eye unacceptable!! and she was rushing to make matters worse she wasn't even being gentle. also didn't even clean the wax off. no oil no nothing. it seems as if she was mad that she has a job wth. a lot of people out their need a job you should be grateful you have one. and have paying customers like me which make your pay check honey! and you don't treat people that way. it's not our fault the hate your job!! so sure enough its mess up the shape of the brows not to mention much thinner!! ahhh i'm so pissed at this point! when i start to express that i didn't like it. bull dagger stated to say thing that didn't make since and literally bump me out of the way and left. and by the way they don't have a room for waxing it's just this little space in the back with a so called bed that has dirty towels on it, what kind of place is this. after, i requested to speak to a manager about this. the bull dagger, was saying it was my fault?? saying i had thin eyebrow to begin with?? i had a full set of eyebrow people! i wouldn't be getting my eyebrow wax if they were that thin. that makes no since!! she took no responsibly what so ever!! horrible horrible never coming here again. the manager wasn't any better. not good business!! bad customer service!!! girls please don't come here for eyebrows!!! by the way, i didn't have to pay for this service, not like i was going to anyway!!!",1
"this was my second time eating here and it's still my favorite restaurant in vegas.....i'm sure there are places with better food, or a better wine list, but i'm willing to bet they are buried deep inside a hotel or a casino and no matter how much you dress them up, and decorate the room, none can match the amazing ambiance of mon ami gabi.  the food, staff, and atmosphere are unmatched anywhere in vegas and truly reminded me of being in paris fr. .   if you're lucky enough to get seating on the patio, or just inside near the windows you will be treated with the amazing water fountain show at the bellagio every fifteen minutes.  it is most definitely the most romantic place to have dinner in vegas.......you will not be disappointed.",5
"today i had my new garage door opener installed by robert.  one of the two owners.  he was on time , professional, nice and did a great job‼‼he even programmed my homelink in my car.  the price i was quoted is the price i paid.  i highly recommend this company‼",5
"had breakfast this morning. we upgraded our room at checkout and got complimentary buffet tickets. i got to say according to the reviews i saw,  i didnt think i was gonna like this place but i loved it. i was surprised at how good it was. the steak was beautifully cooked. the omelette was delicious and the twice cooked potatoes were d delicious too. would definitely go again",4
"quite possibly, the best steak i've ever eaten.  perfectly prepared - with a signature char that is heavenly.  also delicious creamed spinach.  wonderful crab cake for ap.  great meal! pricey and memorable.",5
"first time visiting. very yummy donuts love how beautiful they look almost too beautiful to eat, also had an amazing delicious latte. the staff is very friendly the decor is modern and chic and the shop is very clean. the prices are very reasonable. we got the cannoli donut and the raspberry donut. i was very surprised and happy to see it was homemade raspberry jam inside not the process stuff that most places put in.",5
"i was attracted to this place because of the reviews and pictures.  i ordered 3 pastrami sandwiches, vegetable broth and 3 mango smoothies.  the server wrote down what and how i wanted the pastrami sandwiches done. this was a waste of time because he got the order wrong.  three sandwiches were done with rye bread when only one was ordered with rye bread.  i can keep going on with what they screwed up on the sandwiches but i'll spare you.  the vegetable broth was supposed to come with quinoa.  i saw none!  i give every business a chance and i want food places to succeed but this place was highly disappointing!  i spent 48$ and change and tipped so it was over 50$.  i've had better sandwich experiences at subway.  the sandwiches for the size are over priced and the pastrami was sub par!  the ratings for this place are not legitimate.  i'll never go back to this place and i wouldn't be surprised if they won't be open in 3 years!",1
"as a full-time realtor, i come across clients needing care for their parents and grandparents from time to time.  i had the fortunate experience of meeting the owner of home care assistance of phx, jeff hill, about a year ago and i've been referring his company ever since. 

they have a wide variety of in-home-care options for most budgets and their caretakers are second to none.  not only do i refer clients to hca i also referred my own family after another company brought bedbugs into their home.  

great and extremely professional company that takes care of your loved ones!  definitely worth 15 minutes of your time if you're seriously considering in-home care.",5
this store used to suck but it looks like recently they've shaped up. top customer service and the pharmacist is very knowledgable.,5
"was not sure if we'd be getting service or not.  came in for dinner & drinks with a small group of ladies and i felt like we were bothering the host and servers for being there.   it took a long time to get menus and once we ordered, it was an hour before we got our food. (3 burgers, 1 salad and 1 mac & cheese).  after awhile the service from our server got a bit better. 

food was good.  if you're wanting to sit and wait a long for service & food and don't mind being snubbed by the staff, this is the place for you.",1
had gargantuan sandwiches and they were horrible. we have probably eaten at least 20 sandwiches from this jimmy johns since they opened. the bread was less than fresh. not enough mayo so they were dry. finally there was a long hair in my wife's sandwich. at $23 it was not cheap. too bad their sandwiches used to be great and dependable. don't know if we will order in the future.,1
"two of us came in on a friday night around 8pm. we were able to find seats at the bar. it should be noted that they don't take reservations. 

i'd recommend the chips and guac to start off. if you're in to margaritas, definitely get the sampler - blood orange is my favorite.

the only tacos i've had were the chicken tacos, which were slightly spicy in a good way. the tacos were served with fresh tortillas separate from the meat and two types of salsa. the taco plate was enough to split between people especially after eating the chips and guac.

i'd definitely come here again!",5
"great vegan and veggie choices.
been here many times. the our last view was a real treat!
i had been craving a chimi for years and the sweet server said he would go back and ask if they could do a vegan one....of course they could! i ordered a bean and cheeze and avocado chimi :d i wish i took a pic of it it was soooo yummy and gooey and ridiculous :d i asked for black beans with mango salsa on top as my side. 

anyway, this place will make you just about anything you want. i even requested the kale salad be put into a wrap before and yep they did it.

service is slow sometimes but always pleasant. the owner is a sweetheart, glad he left what he was doing to open his nacho daddy's ;) 

we had a yelp event at the one at henderson and after that we tried hendo location again after that....ummmm we are not a fan. 

we have had some yummy veggie fajitas here also (don't know if they are a menu item). you can't beat their nachos. i wish they had a cauliflower buffalo vegan nacho like i have made at home then i would truly be in heaven. my fav item is still the kale salad. it's that dressing, that grilled corn, delicious. 


that spicy tofu burrito is out of this world but wow it's freaking spicy i don't know how my bro in law nor my hubby eats that. they always inhale theirs.

i'm not a fan of adult drinks and hubby is allergic to tequila (in an oopma loompa turning orange type of way) so not really sure about their margs etc but my friend said her special tooty fruity marg was super yum and super strong. 

nacho daddy is the nacho daddy.",4
"i wanted to send my daughter something special to her work on her birthday. after reading numerous reviews i choose roadrunner florist. tina was wonderful in helping me select just the right plant for someone who has an allergy to most flowers and manages to kill most plants. the plant is beautiful and should survive well in her office setting. oh, and also the cookies were well received and quickly devoured! great customer service is a priority with me and you certainly accomplished that with your personal touch and attention to detail, as well as timely delivery. thank you again and i am pleased to share my experience with others!",5
"amazing. seriously, went there with 14 girl friends for a bachelorette party and were expecting a cheesy dance show. cheesy, a bit, but hot, young, awesome guys, for sure. we all agreed it was one of the best things we did all weekend. well worth the money. my only complaint are the drinks, but whatever. the show itself was awesome. with a group of girls in vegas for a bachelorette part, go to this show!",5
"there valentines special they are offering this week is a great value! lots of food, several selections all for $32.  includes appetizer, main course, bread, and desert.  pleasant environment, not noisy, and quick service.  our meal was piping hot! they recently remodeled adding extra space and more openness.",4
"excellent food, a relaxed atmosphere, large portions, and outstanding desserts.

for those of you that need someone to come along and tell you where to sit, how to order, how to sit, what to eat, etc. on your ""date night"".....go to starbucks and get yelled at......leave the seats for someone more appreciative.",5
"my lunch partner and i decided we wanted some chicken tenders and fries for lunch.  i had heard about the american deli that recently opened on south blvd so i looked at their website and menu.  we were in luck - they had chicken tenders and fries, so we decided to give them a try.  

the place is clean and the ladies are friendly, but there are some points that stand out instantly once we left their online website and walked into their actual store in person.  it's sparse; i mean, like stark inside.  i noticed the fresh paint on the walls then my eyes fell to the booths and chairs and tables bolted to the floor.?.  really?  my partner also noticed that there was nothing on any of the tables, not even salt & pepper??  the energy of the place was off putting, it felt weird in there to me.

i noticed a few hand written signs all stating completely obvious statements to people with any home training like ""no free cups of water"" and the obligatory ""no public restrooms"".  i also couldn't help but notice printed in all caps right on the receipt ""no refunds, no returns, no exchanges"" which doesn't exactly give one a feeling of confidence in what they're going to get.  there was also an unusual sign at the register saying that they would open and inspect every plate before leaving the counter to be certain it was prepared correctly.  wow.  how many of your customers have come in, ordered, eaten most of it and then asked for a refund or tried to say it wasn't what they ordered?  the answer?  clearly far too many or these types of signs wouldn't be necessary.
  
i watch as other orders are brought to the counter and see the ladies opening the boxes and looking at the food with the customer... no hand washing, no hair nets, no gloves, no nothing.  these ladies are not cooks so aren't held to the same cleanliness standards of hair nets or gloves and they are visibly playing on their phones, touching the register and money = i do not want them putting their hands anywhere near my food! 

my order number was called and i go to the counter and she inspects my food.  it looked pretty enough, and there was a lot of food for the price.  i opened the box at my bolted down table and took a bite of the fries.  they were basic crinkle fries.  then i took a bite of one of the chicken tenders and instantly tasted that familiar fishy overtone of chicken that's been fried in the same oil as fish = yuck!  that was it for me...  i drank a little of my coke, ate a few of the fries and tossed my entire meal in the trash.  we then drove down the street and bought two more lunches at showmar's that were edible.
  
so today's little trial was a complete fail for me and i will certainly not be back.  i wish this place would change it's name because this is as far from a ""deli"" as you could possibly imagine.  no fresh meats or cheeses here.  clearly i am not american deli's target customer just as american deli is not at all my target lunch spot.",2
if not for the slow naan bread delivery this would most certainly be a 5 star review. the food is delicious and for the price it can not be beat. the lunch buffet is always a smart choice and i feel i have to specifically point out how fresh and insanely tasty the naan bread is. i would come here for that alone.,4
"dessert is simply best for all people. the into class is great for anyone just getting started or who needs a refresher. yoga is always great for me. so i liked this place very much. if want to interact with great people while furthering your yoga practice, try out this studio. heidi is especially easy to talk and teach you about the posture and benefit of yoga.",5
"stopped into the because we liked the building's architecture, and i was very excited to discover what we walked into. the bar was too full on a saturday evening to play one of their video games, but their menu was a video game in itself!

although a little overwhelming at first, the game themed drinks menu was very entertaining to read and the drinks wonderfully varied. we went with the lime coconut & slap n tickle. loved how the bartender made it, very flavorful and not too much of anything.

from the menu, the spam maki and pork belly buns stood out. for those who do not turn their nose up at spam meat, the maki roll tasted like a low-carb tempura tuna roll. like, how does one taste rice from a bit of spam...? i enjoyed how the uniqueness. and as for the pork belly buns, they were extremely rich--which was offset by the side of cucumbers you sandwich in there. the pork belly marinade was too flavorful for us, so we did not finish it, but it would go very well with a lighter flavored dish.

the service was also very attentive and efficient. i enjoyed seeing how quickly customers were able to choose their tab using the tablets the server's carried around.

i'll be back for more tastes in the near future!",5
"the nightclub here was waaay too small.  we had gotten there really early, since we had free drink tickets, but when we got in the bar was so crowded it took us forever to get our drinks.  plus, the drinks were much more diluted that i'd like... there were girl dancers laying around, dancing, fanning themselves with these feather fans, which was pretty cool, and the music was actually really great to dance to and we ended up staying the whole night until closing.  the dj played great hip\/hop songs from way back when...like hot in here by nelly, that just brought back memories of great high school days.  however, the venue is just too small, and i'd recommend going next door to tao.",3
"the place feels like a dressed up pizza parlor, probably because that is what it was before the ownership change. the wild mushroom brushetta appetizer was good, flat breads were also good. the crème brulee was delicious. very attentive service and the owner, lincoln, was very friendly as well.",3
"i came there without an appointment and they were all really friendly with me.

now three weeks after my visit my acryl nail prolonging is on the way to grow out and it splits up a lil bit but thats just normal.

i was so fascinated how fast she did her work (tami) and how beautiful she made the nail polish on them...

would definitely recommend this place to everybody for those acryl nails and even for those shellac manicures... it looked really beautiful at the other customers.",5
"these people should run mcdonalds, but not high end restaurant. they rush you from the beginning and constantly remind that you need to leave by certain time as new batch of customers coming soon. good luck with that approach!",1
this park is lovely. there are free roaming deer and you can feed them. you can park your car in the reuteallee.,5
"beware of the service department!  the service quality was decent but their billing and charging practices are poor.  in my case, they calculated my charges incorrectly and when i questioned the service advisor on it, he became very condescending and unnecessarily defensive.

best to avoid this place altogether, but if you must, carefully examine your bill at the end.",1
"excellent service, amazing food! fantastic beer selection! love the new addition which is the patio! they need to open another shop up in barrie but it's worth the drive to newmarket!!!",5
delayed flight by 2 and a half hours. wow! unacceptable!!!! now i have to sit next to this??? lol casino games are here tho so i can spend more money than i already lost in vegas!!!! geez :( lol,2
i was very pleased with my experience at viva salon. i'm new to vegas and was looking for a new stylist. one of my coworkers said she goes here so i gave it a try! my schedule matched up with a stylist named julia. i got highlights and a hair cut. i also got a kerastase deep conditioning treatment for being a new client of hers! my hair looks and feels amazing. the salon is beautiful and everyone i encountered was friendly. needless to say i will be back!,5
"get take out or go late in the morning to avoid the long wait. aside from that, this was the best breakfast i've ever had. period. the pancakes were perfect. i didn't know pancakes could be this good. the bacon and hashbrowns were equally amazing. you might ask, how can you improve upon bacon, hashbrowns, and pancakes?  a fair question. the answer is, go try it and find out, you slacker.",5
came with a large group to have some good eats and cheap drinks. i was blown away by the food. if you want food with flavor this is place is a must stop.,5
"it was my first time ever going here. the food was really good. my aunt brought me here. apparently the name hasn't been changed on yelp yet but its now called meat, chix, and weiners. i got a 12 piece chicken finger with honey bbq sauce. i wasnt a big fan of the sauce but the fingers came out steaming hot and were way better then raising canes in my opinion. i highly recommend trying this place out.",4
"c'était ok, sans plus. 

resto au décor typique italien. l'ambiance était agréable quoi que le resto était vide. une femme et vraisemblablement sa mère étaient assises au fond et parlaient italien avec verve. nous avons commandé une lasagne et des pâtes carbonara. ces dernières ne devaient pas être assez chaudes lors du service puisque l'oeuf n'était pas cuit dans les pâtes, faisant un genre de fond d'assiette gluant. par contre, la lasagne fut bonne et apprécié de mon compagnon. le service était courtois et prompt.",3
"ordered the hertz car at the palms resort in las vegas for 9:00 and the next day and when we arrived at 9:00 the hertz representative was not there. at 9:45 we received a call to pick up the car.

when we went to the car we found it dirty inside and out. the car had recently been smoked in as well. standard dings and dents for a rental car with 34,000 miles.

ford focus 2013 ran poorly, sputtered often on acceleration. 

went to drop the car off exactly 48 hours after we picked it up. of course the hertz representative had to finish her text before we were served. computer down unable to print invoice but was assured invoice would be emailed asap.

a day later received invoice and was billed an extra hour for bringing the car back. of course nothing mentioned the fact that we picked up the car 45 minutes late.

poor service will not use herz again.",1
"i had the goat cheese spinach burger and it tasted very good. service was ok as well. after reading all the negative reviews about the bug on the floor and the poor hygiene, no hand washing after dealing with the cash register and food back and forth etc. i kinda lost my appetite. even though i had a good exprerience at this location and the burger was very tasty, i would like to be sure that every time i go to this location i get the same great service with clean washed hands and no bugs in the kitchen that could end up in my burger. yikes.",5
"tried to buy a printer here on 12\/29\/14, clearly on sale in the store flyer, in-stock. i held the unopened box in my hand. 

the staff were so disorganized and so ill-prepared to do their jobs i left empty handed, they missed the sale all because they don't know how to do their jobs even on a fundamental level. a follow-up phone call demonstrated the store staff simply don't care whatsoever. 

a follow-up check with staples customer service online showed the rep never read the email, only responded to a particular keyword. laziness or lack of skill? perhaps a lack of abilty to read english.

if you shop here be prepared to deal with poorly trained kids as employees.  my money ended up with amazon, free shipping at the same price. this is a good example of why so many brick and mortar stores are closing.

i learned my lesson and will never again darken their door.",1
leah is amazing!! the food is extremely good and so fresh totally great experience! this is our new staple..,5
"i've visited this place about four times. the menu has a decent amount of options. from steak sandwiches, to souvlaki and gyro wraps, they aren't your typical burger place. i always just get the big boy burger combo with a poutine, that's just my go to at a burger joint. to review the food, the burger is indeed quite big as advertised...the poutine was pretty good, not my favourite, very salty, thick potatoes. the burger was tasty, also kind of salty. their options of condiments are good, variety of tasty sauces and fresh veggies. i would say the burger is pretty comparable to hero certified burgers, but a little bigger. very standard prices for a burger joint you're looking at spending around 9-14 dollars. i actually kinda like the layout of the restaurant, its cool and different. every time i've been there they've been playing edm on sirius xm, which is kind of cool and different. 

all in all i'd say its a good place to eat and i'd rather spend my money here keeping this place alive than most chain burger places. but im only going to give it 3 stars...cause im a harsh critic and i only want to give the best of the best 4 stars and above. i would give it 3.5 stars if i could...get on that yelp

cl",3
always go to the clearance section. look at reduced meats and cheeses.,4
i love this place!!!! it is perfect for a quick bite of yummy sushi. prices are great and i love the guys standing in front of you making the sushi for the revolving bar. i eat here about twice a week.,5
"disappointing steak. 
that would be the most important part of a steakhouse experience, and the one i received was completely underwhelming. the service was good and quick, and the restaurant was clean and very nice. 

the kobe beef tartare appetizer was good, not as good as the one at ramsays ""steak"" restaurant though. 

my girlfriend had the wild mushroom ravioli and it was an excellent dish, absolutely delicious. i wish i had ordered that instead of my steak. 

the steak i ordered was the dry aged new york. i ordered medium rare and received something that was cooked past medium but i was too hungry to wait for a replacement as offered by the waiter. it wouldn't have mattered much, as it was a flavorless and stringy cut of meat, with the dry aged flavor only coming through in the last bits around the bone. it was not satisfying and definitely not worth the price. i've had better steaks at outback, and for a quarter of the price. 

i'd stop by for another bowl of that ravioli, but at this time i wouldn't go there for a steak again. i only visited brand because i was staying in the monte carlo, but i should have made the trip up to stk or steak again.",2
by far the best massage i've had. i'll definitely be back and recommend this place to friends and family.,5
"i go back and forth between two states and was asked to provide both i.ds, which i did. the actual manager delinda said she cannot help me with anything because people with my kind of situation has a high fraud in nevada and i would need to get proof i am a citizen here in all and that maybe over the phone will service me. this place is in the mall in a corner and they do not help locals here. while i was there waiting for my ids to return in 20 mins, another family walked out upset as well. buyer beware!",1
"the restaurant is simple but the food is beyond excellent. 

have been there three times. definitely would love to go again. 

the price is quite lovely as well : )",5
"so pleased and happy at the way my baby's first haircut turned out! i absolutely love it! better than i could have imagined. after reading poor reviews and miserable experiences at other establishments that cut kids hair, i decided to give arizona hair a shot. erika was amazing!! i can't praise her enough. not only is she experienced at cutting children's hair as she does her own kids, but she worked quickly yet efficiently with amazing results. she knew exactly what to do to make my baby feel comfortable with the whole experience. i didn't have a screaming crying scared baby which made the process so wonderful. i can't stop staring at my baby's beautiful cut! great job erika!",5
"the food was decent, however, the staff began cleaning the floor with lemon lysol during the middle of our lunch. the smell was unbearable and we ended up just leaving our half eaten lunch behind. really was a waste of money.",1
"the pedicures are great, slightly more expensive than other places, so it's only worth it if you're already shopping in down town summerlin. 
the gel manicure wasn't my favorite. the nail polish collects at the tip making it slightly darker at the tips and is a little bit wavy. i definitely won't be back again for a gel manicure. but i have been here before for a regular (non gel) manicure and it turned out great and the polish lasted an entire week! normally polish lasts me 3-4 days so i was pretty excited about it lasting longer. 
the staff is very friendly here, they don't sit in front of you ignoring you while talking in a different language to their coworkers so i really appreciated that! so i'll give them 4 stars! if only they were better at gel manicures i could give 5 stars but then again maybe i got a nail tech that isn't the best with gel? who knows.",4
"wow! i didn't know they donuts were made fresh to order. i wasn't too adventurous this time, but it didn't matter. the donuts melt in your mouth and are delicious with just enough sweet. the flavors offered will satisfy everyone as they have a build your own option. can't eat these all the time, but they will definitely be an occasional treat.",5
"upon my arrival for my appointment, i was treated rudely.  i asked if the woman needed my living social number, and she said ""i said i just want you to sit down."" like i was a child.

from there it just got more blunt and cold. she asked when the last time i had my eyebrows waxed. i told her i honestly didn't recall, but that i never go longer than a week.  she said she absolutely needed to know. i told her, again, i didn't know... but i estimated 3 or 4 days.  she said this wasn't good enough.  she was scolding me.

i mean, i am sorry but i do work. i don't always remember silly little waxings. meanwhile, she kept reiterating that she needes to know because anything under a week was important to know. i told her that if i wrote once a week for ten years than no matter what the exact time line, it was less than a week. so why was she giving me such a hard time??

i told her she was making me uncomfortable from the get go, and if we could please start over.  that i really wanted the service but that i wanted to stop being yelled at.  

she said that because i told her that i felt uncomfortable, she was now uncomfortable. she asked me to leave.

so, i took a day off of work for nothing. and then i had to spend a considerable amount of time with living social getting my refund.

awful. 

i will never walk in those doors again. 
and i will tell everyone i know to never go there either.  i don't know what about my phyaical appearance bothered her so much, made her treat me that way, but wow.  awful.",1
"amazing!
the service was fantastic and the food was as well.  the roasted tomato soup was a dream and i had maybe the best ceasar salad i have ever had.  it was expensive for soup and salad but i am still thinking about that meal and any sit down place on the vegas strip is going to be a little pricey.  eating at this restaurant made me want to stay in the hotel even though the two may not necessarily be connected.",5
"it is one of my favorite food trucks among those near book store. always a good choice for a quick lunch after class. food are nice, not expensive and worthy. i especially like the mix rice which is not shown on the main menu, love the combination of veges meat and rice.",5
"just moved to this side of town, drove by and my little ones wanted ice cream so we stopped by. they had cookie monster, i had the rainbow sherbet. both were really good. they have a lot on the menu. we also tried the macaroons, the taro and fruity pebbles. very good as well. glad we found this place, will be back to try boba and coffee !",5
"enjoyed the saturday night concert series last night. very family friendly. music was fun from the mint julep jazz band, beer and wine were available to purchase, kids could play and dance with freedom in the soft grass. great setting for a concert. my only complaint is the intense reflective light from the buildings that ruined the shade we had for most of the night. overall - a great event and nice park!",5

"i took my girlfriend here after a nice valentines day dinner as she is a huge cupcake fan.  we purchased 4 cupcakes (around $12 total) which seemed a little expensive for 4 cupcakes.  the cupcakes were ok, but my biggest complaint is that the icing is so high on the top you cannot possibly eat it without getting icing on your face or looking like a fool while eating it.  maybe this is a cupcake catered to kids that really enjoy the icing, but as an adult i do not want to fish icing out of my beard.",2
"i love their gelato but if i wanted teenage dairy queen service, i would've gone to dairy queen.   generally the products they carry are very good.  the setup is a bit odd, as you have to start lining up in the back of the store which often creates a lot of traffic by the door.  the staff don't know much about the product nor do they seem to care.  it's too bad.  they now offer gelato cakes, when i asked what a gelato cake was, i was told ""it's like a gelato cake"" ... when i inquired further the response i got was ""it has crumbs... i think"".  seriously, please train your staff.  i bought a cupcake to go which was thrown into a bag (??).  i really felt that my whole experience was ruined.  the place has such great potential.",3
"used to love this place, until the manager ruined it... terrible food, even worse service, and a manager that acts like you insulted her personally (and takes it personally) if you complain... after you've waited 20minutes for the mayo that they forgot on your sandwich... after youve asked 3 times lol... just don't tell them you've had bad service.",1
"well, you sure as shite get what you pay for here. i'm a student, so i do appreciate having any $10\/month gym option. and when i go during the day, it's not too busy, which lets me fumble around the machines with less embarrassment. 

the staff, though, are laughably incompetent. and they--rather than fellow gym-goers-- make me feel like i'm on an episode of jersey shore. i love the jersey shore, so that isn't all bad, but it is if you need any sort of help. 

the other day, i asked how to get the tv audio to feed into the elliptical. the guy at the front counter told me the ellipticals couldn't get sound. then the girl next to him said, no, some of them get sound. so a third girl came over and started testing all the ellipticals before giving up and sort of frumping away quietly. i asked someone using the elliptical, and in about ten seconds they'd explained it to me. all the machines work--you just have to be using it before sound will start. 

another time my friend and i signed up for their create-a-program thing. we were ignored for the first twenty minutes as the staff member directed all her attention on someone else. then, she proceeded to try and sell us weight-loss pills. neither of us are remotely overweight. it was kind of hilarious. we now refer to the gym as ""planet shitforbrains.",3
"the best pizza ever.
i had a personal calzone and a personal white pizza, decent price with fantastic taste. i had them with the money i won from slot machine, which might brought me even better experience.
i loved here definitely.",5
"a favorite for mexican in my home town. the combos give more than enough to eat, so i almost always have some to take home. also very affordable. yelp says the restaurant is closed on sundays, but it is open.",5
"how many places can you enjoy a drink (wine, beer or cocktail) outdoors in vegas while watching your kid entertain him\/herself for hours? i can't think of many, and none as cool as dcp--although it's really more of a modern outdoor mall than a ""park."" cool place for a casual me.et up too, as there are a bunch of fun places to eat and shops\/mini galleries to check out without a high ""commitment"" factor.
food wise, i think the most notable spots are cheffini's creative hot dogs, stacey dougan's vegan to-go (second floor) and the perch, where you can enjoy a flatbread or share plate with a nice view. it's just a little grown-uppy. bin 702 is also cool for a glass of wine and a bar bite. 
they have a program of performances and activities on the stage\/lawn area.",4
"scam alert!

i called bell honda and spoke to sales manager, brandon latour. i asked if he had a particular vehicle that i had a hard time finding in the south western region. he said they had the exact truck i wanted on their lot (""i'm looking at it right now. come on down!"") getting me to drive all the way down there to find out that they never did. (to bell's credit, i worked with brent harris once i got there, and found him to be a very professional and knowledge sales person. i would have purchased from him, but the flat out lie from brandon latour made it impossible to do so. if you do decide to go here, ask for brent harris.)

i ended up getting a call from autonation honda chandler as i walked out the door, and was informed that they did have the exact vehicle, and it was the newer model year. the price was better than what anyone else quoted for last years model, and there was no haggling or b.s. involved.",1

"***this review is for the spa***

i hadn't been to this spa for a while but wanted to get a manicure so made an appointment. it used to be called spa atmosphere and was quite nice. but now, it is m spa and some other section for men only. walking in it just seemed shabby, with a shelf of crap for sale on one side, a tray with some ugly science class erlenmeyer flasks filled with colored liquids, and a very rude bitch working at the desk who talked to me like i was there to clean her toilet.

anyway, i went into the inside part. boy has it changed. instead of going to this other part in your own room for your treatment, there is some common room with low quality furniture all over the place. luckily it was empty when i was there.

so i sat at my station which was practically in the hallway, next to a generic fake plant. the nail bowl looked dirty. i sure hope they sterilize their equipment because the girl doing my nails would just pull tools from like a junk drawer. what happened to those individually wrapped sterilized sets? 

as i was looking at the table, i saw old nail clippings on it. sick!

about the treatment itself, it sucked. i could have given myself a better manicure blindfolded with my non-dominant hand. i didn't get any cuticle oil or lotion even. i had to tell her to do a base coat. i am no esthetician but even a child knows to use a base coat under your polish. so the color coat on top was smeared on like crap all over the place with one stripe of top coat at the end.

and the price for this monstrosity? $40. that's right. 

i am not ever returning to that sh*thole of a place they call a spa with heir dirty, poor quality, rude services. i would rather throw $40 off the side of a bridge than spend it there again. then at least a homeless man could find it and have a happy moment on some cheap drugs. that is far better than any $ going to this poor excuse for a spa.

enough said.",1
not too sure what to think about this place it's not really a mexican restaurant it's more of the bar taco shop more bars than anything music spray loud live dj which is great for a bar so if you're looking for a place to just go out and eat that one and go here but definitely a place to go eat and hang out have some fun very much so now for the food i have the calabasa the chile relleno and octopus calabasa it's pretty good plenty of flavor squash was cook pretty good not too mushy so it had some firmness to it the chile was my favorite hot full of cheese how can you beat that octopus i was most excited for it i almost puked it was disgusting it tastes like rotten fish never again will i get back ipad an octopus at many a places nothing that tasted that disgusting the ceviche was okay little flavorless would not get it again the thing i would go out of my way to get would be there churros they may not be authentic that they are damn good i'm from tally and growing up on them i know a good churro and is probably the best tasting one ever crunching outside light and fluffy in the inside perfect amount of cinnamon sugar and my wife says they have the best long island iced tea she's ever had that's pretty much all she drinks anywhere we go service was good we sat at the bar so we got our drinks right when they find them and the food runs are kind of dumb the end over any food win saw that kept on getting food mixed up between people but no big deal definitely go back for the churros and a long island's if if not anything else,4
"i'm very disappointed in vasco rx. my insurance company cut our benefits again, thank you mr. president, and won't cover my medicine any longer. they sent me some other cream that was total crap, and i just wasted $49 that i cannot afford to waste. it's sticky and gross, and useless for my situation. i had to shower again, and change clothes. i'm a military wife who is too sick to work, and so we are living in northern ca. where everything is unaffordable, and it's killing us financially. vasco rx wants $1,100 for my medicine. and my insurance company only paid them $193 for my medicine. linda was uncaring when i explained my situation, and even broke down in tears. i'm so done with the greed by everyone in this country. no one cares about people anymore. it's all about the bottom line, and padding their own pockets. i would not recommend buying any of their cheap creams unless you like feeling sticky. the higher end stuff is great, just out of reach for poor hard working middle class people like us with crappy benefits.",1
"came in here for lunch with a coworker last week. quite good!

it's very small inside, there is seating for probably 15 people, max. but we got in quite early (12pm) so there was still some seating left. 

disappointed when we ordered, as we both wanted the fried chicken blt, and she told us they only had one left. but you guys open at 11am.. you were able to sell out within an hour? but i guess it turned out for the better, cuz then we decided to try the calamari po boy and share the two sandwiches so we can try both. the calamari po boy was the winner. it was seasoned so nicely, and nice and crunchy. the chicken was good too, but a little bland. 

we opted for the garlic wedges and coleslaw. both were so good! i've heard the seaweed salad is great too, so i'll give that a shot next time.",4
"absolutely horrible , i got two orders from the same shop at arrowhead mall , and none were correct ! the first gift that i ordered was missing a word , and when i told the associate , she asked about a receipt which they have not gave me the day before by one of the other associates that gave me it . my second order was a disaster , it was supposed to be picked up the day that i had a birthday party , i went to the same store in arrowhead mall , and they completely in graved on the wrong item !! i can not believe how irresponsible the associates there ! absolutely rude . upon my arrival and informing her that that is not the item that i ordered , the manager was right there and did not even come to explain the situation and tried to avoid me as much as possible ,very rude manager ! to be honest , this is one of the worst stores i've ever been to and was the worst experience i had . never going back",1
"service was very good, employees were very nice. food was bland and overpriced. canes by far wins in this category. it looked so good, new building new place for me... but very disappointed. there was no flavor cooked into the meats, when i say bland.. it's like they didn't season the meat before they fried it. just fried it right out of the packaging. i wanted to love this place. but canes never fails me.",2
yummy vegan brownie and  the cauliflower mashed potatoes were amazing!  traveled a couple hours away to try the place.,5
"i have been going here since it opened, but never gave a review. i have gotten my eyebrows done at different places in town. i've been a regular at db, eyebrows r us, and patel's. what i did not like about those places is that they did not take their jobs professionally. at db, if they're on the phone they will make you wait until they finish their conversation, and they have done this to me a couple of times already. given that i have done that once during a visit, but it was for a very good reason. patel's customer service was lacking. both db and eyebrows r us are not as careful as shila's. shila's was the only place where they never cut me or left blood marks. i don't really trust db and eyebrows r us anymore because my eyebrows were a little bit uneven every time i get them done at their places. shila's would take their time to make sure that my eyebrows were perfectly even. threading hurts less when i go to shila's. i just love their friendly and professional atmosphere. i don't trust my eyebrows anywhere else but shila's. i have tried almost every eyebrow threading business in town, and shila's is by far the best. her business has the best deals, best service, great hours, great location, and i love their cute little place. :)",5

i don't know what happened to my last review i give it 5 stars the burger optional choices are excellent the fries are excellent the soda fountain is superb but takes a little getting to know how to use it but it's worth it after you understand how it works it is the best soda machine around. the manager came over to my wife and i and asked us how we liked the meal we loved it and asked if he could get us refills from the soda machine which are free. while waiting for the food to be cooked they have free peanuts all you can eat which was a very nice touch if you're kind of hungry before your meal.l not many places like this place the prices are worth the food,5

"we were looking forward to nob hill after trying stripsteak(another mina restaurant) on a previous trip. we tried the spring tasting menu with the wine pairing. to jot it down quickly, the appetizers were very good(caesar salad & shrimp louie), but the main course, the braised short rib was surprising bland. our best wine was served with the appetizers(veltliner 'steinagrund'), while our pinot noir was just as uninspiring as the main course. the savior was the excellent desserts(english toffee & banana-caramel sundae), but the wine was a little too sweet, even for a muscat. we're glad we tried nob hill, but there's a large gap between it and stripsteak.",3
"was recently in vegas with my family for a bodybuilding show and was looking for some supplements at near by stores. almost all the supp stores i visited were either over priced or didn't have the variety i was looking for until i came across vegas discount nutrition. they had everything you could imagine! from protein to pre workouts, recoveries and much more. the variety was outstanding, the most favors i've ever seen in one store! and the prices were the best, the lowest prices around without a doubt. the staff there was very friendly and extremely knowledgable in the supplement field, all of them were nafc certified nutritionist. they even offered free samples on the way out! i couldn't ask for anything more. i recommend this store to anyone looking for any type of supplementation. i will definitely be returning to vdn on my trips out to vegas.",5
we were here for dinner and i have to say i wasn't very impressed.  the presentation was good but the quality of the food was below average for what we paid.  i wouldn't come back.,2
ok do you guys know that fresh restaurant sells some items  gmo i was told that by a watier an i was very mad because i go there all the time.. and i really thought they celebrate more farmers market & local market knowing full well the studies done on genetically modified organism will never go back again tks,1
"just moved to vegas from michigan, home of pinball pete's, which i believe was also started by the same man who opened this place, so my expectations were high. i was not disappointed. 

if you're looking for pinball, i can't imagine a better place to go. they have a wide assortment of pinball from every decade. all of the most popular games from my generation are there. addams family. twilight zone. theatre of magic. attack from mars. star trek: tng. many of them have new colored displays, which is really cool. if you're a hardcore pinball fan, most of the games you're probably looking to play are there. 

nearly all of the machines were up and running and in working order. you're not going to play a game there and be irritated because the lights are out, the flippers don't work, or the balls keep getting stuck. the playfields are in top condition.

they also have plenty of the newest stern games to play, mostly either music themed (kiss, ac\/dc, metallica) or movie themed (ghostbusters, iron man, avatar). prices range from $1 per play for the 2010's machines, .75 cents for the 2000's, 50 cents for the 80's and 90's, and so on. discounts if you purchase 3 games. plenty of change machines. 

there are also a few arcade games, including a mame type arcade with a hundred or so classics. the cabinets are older, but are in working order. most of the games are from the 70's and 80's. there is also a air hockey game and a air bowling game. but it's 85-90% pinball here. no big cabinet machines, and no multi cabinet racing games or anything like that. no redemption games. 

it's smaller than it looks like in the pictures and what i expected. the aisles between the machines are pretty tight. if it's busy, there will not be a lot of room to maneuver around. if you have kids who like to run around and if you like moving from machine to machine, you might want to go when it's not as busy. if you are with a large group of people, same deal. you won't be able to crowd around one machine and watch your friends play. 

the biggest aisle was the aisle with the vintage machines pre-1980's, which nobody was playing when i was there. personally, i think there are too many of them. the space could be better put to use. i understand that this is also like a museum, but my impression was that people weren't taking pictures or appreciating it as a museum, they just wanted to play pinball-and the newer games were more of a draw. 

there isn't a concession stand-only a couple of vending machines and a popcorn machine. if you work up an appetite, you're out of luck. i don't recall seeing any tables to sit at, either. want to take a break? you're out of luck. this place is really more for the hardcore pinball fan and not so much a casual place to throw a party for a large group of kids or people. it's not chuck e cheese. there are plenty of arcades in vegas that would be more appropriate for that sort of gathering. 

if you don't have a car and you're a tourist, you'll need to take a taxi. it's not walkable. it's a couple of miles east of mgm grand. it's a good distance from northern resorts like wynn and venetian. 

the only machine they didn't have that i wished they did was the who's tommy from 1994. it's my favorite, and if this is a true museum, you have to have the pinball wizard. maybe in the future. 

it's not perfect, but it's close, and i've never been to a place with more machines in one spot. if you're in vegas and you're looking for a good time for a reasonable price, you love pinball, and especially if you're lacking working pinball machines in your area, it's a must stop.",4
"my fiance and i found this place by absolute accident. we were visiting scottsdale and wanted authentic mexican food. by god, we got it! we both had enchiladas (i had cheese, he had chicken) doused in a very spicy (we were both sweating, but in a good way) and delicious green sauce. both came with rice and the smoothest, most delightful refried beans ever. the salsa was amazing, and the tortilla chips are super-thick and crunchy and fried on site. they also gave us both complimentary bowls of a wonderful vegetable beef soup as an appetizer. all of this, plus 2 beers, for a total of $23! the service was also great. the decor is kinda schmaltzy, but i think it added to the charm of the whole affair. it's not a high-end fusion-mexican restaurant like those found in nyc, no, but that's not what we wanted. i'm only sorry i ran out of room and couldn't clean my plate!",5
"as a vietnamese self-proclaimed food critic, i can proudly say that pt noodles' pho is legit. the broth is pure medicine. you can smell and taste proof that they didn't cut any corners when boiling the beef bones and getting the spices just right. it's all you need when you're feeling down, or sick, or just hungry. the cure-all.

noodles are always cooked to perfection. served with mint, bean sprout, onion, jalapeño, and lime. i always get my beef rare on the side (make sure you use lime for this), and it's always good quality you can trust. never sketchy, never brown spots. 

the ice coffee is also great here (vietnamese style uses sweetened condensed milk instead of cream\/sugar)!

waitstaff is always friendly and attentive. fairly priced. overall atmosphere is normal for a pho place. but why bother going in person when they offer free delivery! that's right. you heard it here first. @realwhitneylove b-)",5
"i was there on a saturday afternoon. i ordered chicken wings, it took a while but there were good. waitress was new but nice and helpful. they have good variety of beers. i will come back for sure.",4
this is a real local place with very good food. the staff is very friendly. the gyros were excellent. the baklava little small.,4
"here's the thing about vegas... what was the hot this year will be old news next year.  the competition to stand out as the new best thing is always fierce. well, wicked spoon, you are this year's #1 buffet.

i'm not really a fan of buffets because i feel like there is no perfect dish there and that everything is just mediocre.  however, wicked spoon has a great way of presenting their food in these little pre-portioned iron spoons that make everything look so appetizing.  

crab legs are hot and halved.  the selection of food is good.  overall quality is good.  and the dessert selections are amazing.

make sure you save room for dessert.   i admit, i do have a sweet tooth, but from gelato to chocolate covered strawberries, you'll miss out if you're too full to at least sample a few sweets.",4
i've been going to this barber shop for awhile now. i always see the owner gabriel and i am always happy with the hair cut i receive. like i mentioned above i go there a lot and gabriel knows exactly what i like and i love that! he is always asking how my family is and makes me feel apart of his family. i would give them 10 stars but of course i'm limited to 5. if you want to support a small business with the small business personality you have the right place!!,5
"nikki's is something of a west end institution. it will celebrate its 20th anniversary, this year. i stopped in for a quick breakfast roll, of the haggis variety, and was suitably pleased by my choice. judging by the amount of available floorspace, they're used to managing significant queues at lunchtime, which is no surprise as it's a friendly wee place with an excellent range of lunchtime options.

overall, we said: ""i was impressed with nikki's. the welcome was as warm as you're likely to find, and their haggis roll was as good as i've sampled. i'm happy to now consider this place as my ""go to"" breakfast roll place, as and when i require such sustenance on the way to work. i'd happily recommend you pay them a visit, too, as their deli counter looked really good, and their daily specials sounded very tempting.",4

"this is a nice little italian restaurant conveniently located in a busy part of vaughan. the restaurant seats about 15 tables, most small 2-4 people ones so make sure you make a reservation in advance.

the service is superb. the staff is friendly and attentive. one guy, who i presume is the owner or head chef, goes from table to table to say hello to the patrons, i can tell there's a lot of repeat customers.

the food is quite good as well. i had an arugula salad with fresh parmesan cheese to start and it was light and appetizing. the menu is a small one but their classic items are all well received.",4
the bartender at this bar who would not reveal his name claimed to be a manager then called my best friend a n****r. we literally had just walked in. i would not recommend this bar to anyone.,1
"my cat started exhibiting some strange behaviour and we decided to bring him to the animal emergency clinic, just to be safe. when we arrived, we signed in and the receptionist explained what was going to happen and asked me some questions. 

we were shown into a room where they examined my cat, buster, and the vet discussed some options with us as to what may be wrong. one of her hypotheses ended up being right when he was later diagnosed with a fatal disease, but she gave us a few options and some treatment options as well. they did bloodwork quickly and buster was back with me shortly thereafter. 

while they weren't able to help buster in the long-term, they did help to provide me with a lot of useful information to take away and instructions for what to do should the issues get worse. 

i would recommend this clinic to anyone who cannot get to their regular clinic. beware, the prices are steep but for the well being of your pet, its well worth it!",5
"i give this place a five star for a few reasons...

1- i really dig the roosevelt area. wasn't crowded at all on a sunday afternoon and the surrounding buildings and palm trees make for a great leisurely walk with your coffee.
2- the service was great. the barista working was enjoying  a slower moment out on a bench with friends in front of the shop and as we arrived she got up immediately, greeted us kindly and told us she was going to go wash her hands before helping us and making our drinks. having worked at a coffee joint myself once, i understand the slow times and the perks of helping a shift go by much easier when friends stop by and i'm glad she gets to hang out while understanding the importance of customer service. go you barista lady!
3- the drinks were great! what more can you really ask for when you are purchasing a coffee. i got a large iced mocha with two shots instead of four (four would kill me) and my boyfriend got a medium iced latte. we are kind of coffee snobs and the drinks were wonderful. i normally order an iced toddy or an iced americano but was feeling rather indulgent that day.
4- the atmosphere was my style. big open room, great tunes!, lots of places to sit to use your laptop, seating outside in front of the shop as well as great seating outdoors behind the shop and here's the kicker.. the bathrooms were clean and i didn't cringe or hold my breath while using it.
5- they are local and they hang local art. anything local in my book, is a win.

this place is great. on my days off it will be a great place to sit and escape with my laptop or my current read.",5
"after a red-eye from phx to charlotte (connecting to jamaica), we were famished and this was the only thing open in the charlotte airport.

so good. the concept of a hamburger with the bun reversed with cheese blows my mind. taste like a grilled cheese with hamburger. i love this place. the burgers are very good. the fries are great!,4
"on your way past this shop the fish in the window will catch your eye and draw you in.  these are good fish and a quick glance should be enough to make you want to make a purchase from here.  

the prices aren't outstanding, but remain fairly reasonable and very much on a par with those you get at similar places in the area.  

however, what really counts in this shops favour is the fact that it has a butchers next door so a trip here will cover both your meat and fish needs in one single location.  this fact alone makes it worth a visit especially as the next door butchers is a good one.",4
just the average standard. i had the korean beef tacos. it's okay but nothing special. good place to hang out or relax after work.,3

"first, you will see by my profile this is the first review i've written on yelp--in fact, i almost never write reviews but felt that this was such a missed expectation that i needed to write something.  also, i hope the wahlberg's are reading these reviews because i like the boys and want them to know how the restaurant is operating. 

the wahlberg's should be embarrassed to have their name on this place.  my wife and i have watched the reality show, fans of the boys, and were optimistic about wahlburgers.  we made a 2 1\/2 hour trip from columbus for, among other things, a visit to wahlburgers.

we started by putting our name in for reservations inside.  the hostess said it would be an hour or more. we needed to run an errand so we put our names in anyway.  our table was ready in 20 minutes so they didn't estimate very well....but i guess better to be seated too early than too late.  

the kitchen was oddly positioned facing the patrons and in the walk way of the patrons.  the waiters were constantly jockeying for position with patrons trying to get to the back patio or their seats---it was an awkward set up.  we were seated very close to the kitchen and the waiters station.  

because of our seating, we witnessed complete chaos at the waiters station.  the waitresses and waiters seemed listless and milling around the wait station with little urgency.  the kitchen and wait staff were constantly shuffling orders back and forth back to the kitchen because they couldn't keep track of what order was what and they were getting them wrong and confused.  i saw a woman come in from the patio to complain to the manager (or a senior looking person in a golf shirt) and he didn't seem very sympathetic or apologetic.  i saw her pointing, waiving, and getting agitated and he just looked at her....the most he could muster was ""i'm sorry"" and she stormed away.

it took us (and the couple behind us) almost an hour (58 minutes to be exact) to get our food--2 burgers and an order of fries.  the couple that left as we were getting seated said they waited an hour and 45 minutes.  

our waitress was unapologetic and marginally attentive.  at 50 minutes in to our wait, i walked up to her at the waiter's station to ask how long it might be and she said ""it should be soon"".  when i asked what ""soon"" meant, all she could say is ""i don't know, there are several tickets ahead of you.""  i was visibly getting frustrated and irritated but she never once offered an acknowledgement, much less an apology attempt to placate me.  in fact, she disappeared for almost 10 minutes and my wife thinks it was to avoid us.

to sum it up:  

--the wait was far too long for just a couple of burgers.
--the service was inattentive, seemingly untrained, and lacked the ability to handle adverse situations.
--the kitchen was chaos and awkwardly located.  it actually increased my anxiety and frustration just to watch them.  they looked completely confused.
--the restaurant was clean but felt more like an amusement park cafeteria than a themed burger restaurant
--if this was a hole in the wall cafeteria, i would still be frustrated but i think i actually found myself a little embarrassed for the wahlberg's to have their names on the place.  i am sure they all would be appalled at how the place was operating and was perceived.
++the burger and sweet potato tots were pretty good.  even though it was an hour late, it was fresh, hot and tasted good.",1
"i am addicted! i am so glad i found this place. i have been using their smoothies as meal replacements. i come down here in the morning and get my large breakfast and lunch smoothies. they are really delicious and taste more like dessert but they're packed full of health. some of my favorites include the power lunch, the regulator, the meal ticket, the risengrind and the earthquake. i have noticed that i am much more focused during the day at work; i am not getting crabby and tired. there's no 2 pm rush for candy and caffeine anymore. i've also noticed that while everybody has been getting sick around me at work, i've been bulletproof. incidentally, i've lost 10 pounds in 3 months without trying. their staff is so friendly and welcoming, i feel like i'm coming over to visit my friends every morning.  i highly recommend making this place part of your routine.",5

"for the money the portions are good. i ordered eggs with bacon and 2 pancakes. eggs were good and bacon was typical. the pancakes were heavy and dense, not light or fluffy as was expected and we were only given a small amount of syrup for them. we didn't ask for more so i'm not sure if it would've been free. overall, not a great experience but i've had worse.",3

"i was in charge of organizing my cousins bacherlotte party and it was my first time doing such a event. brandon made it so easy for me to plan it. he gave me tips and a great price. chazzy was our host and she was so nice, helpful,& fun. i would highly recommend them.",5
"first the positives: they had the bridesmaid dress i needed and were helpful in making sure it was the right dress.  for a 25 dollar rush fee i was able to get my dress within 2 months.  they called me promptly to let me know it was there.  

the negatives start from there.  their seamstress deelle was very rude and unprofessional.  my husband came into the store once to hand me something i left in the car and this seamstress actually asked if he was my uber driver.  my husband is a man of color.  when i responded that he was my husband her response was judgmental and not at all apologetic.  given this is pittsburgh, that is not surprising, however these women ought to learn how to serve all potential customers, and not just the white middle class it is clear they cater to.  the old school attitudes of the owners, floor attendants and seamstresses were very apparent as they made no attempt to hide their opinions about a dress that i was purchasing. 

i was outlandishly overcharged for subpar alterations ( my hem was fraying and there were exposed seams everywhere). when i pointed this out to deelle she actually defended her work and argued with me rather than apologizing and responding in an attitude of true customer service.  i understand that this isn't entirely the fault of the store, but i would expect above average quality alterations from the seamstress that is allowed to work out of this store. when i realized just how wildly i was being overcharged, i called to see if my dress was still available to take back to get altered elsewhere.  the owner refused to give me contact information for the woman and was very rude.  she did attempt to contact the seamstress and left a message with me to communicate her unsuccessful attempt to reach deelle.  i eventually heard from deelle.  her response to me was very rude and she acted very offended when i eventually spoke with her. she said something about an unspoken rule where they give people 3 days to change their mind.  i was never told about this and regardless, deelle could have very well communicated this is a much friendlier way.  not professional. 

the bottom line:  i am glad i got my dress in time for the wedding, but i will not be giving these people anymore of my business, and i suggest you don't either. if you do purchase your dress through carlisles i urge you to get your alterations done elsewhere.  that way you won't end up paying over 200 dollars for alterations that look mediocre.",2
"bad service , waited 45 min for appetizer and it never came and we got main entree before it was even ready. an went to cancel it and the waiter had an attitude. had to keep asking several times for silverware and also got attitude for that as well. won't be coming back.",1
"worst pharmacy ever!!!!!!!!! i have thought they would improve but was wrong. they mislabel prescriptions, and are incompetent . go elsewhere .",1
"the bad reviews for this location are blowing my mind! i've been a member here since this location first opened, and i have never had a single issue. 

people complaining about equipment cleanliness are just obnoxious-it's a %#$@ing gym-people sweat. if you haven't realized that people are generally inconsiderate and don't always clean up after themselves, then all i can say is bless your heart. that is the case anywhere. restaurants, grocery stores, shopping stores, coffee shops, you name it. it's a gym-wipe off the equipment before you use it-no big deal. 

they don't offer towels? really, you're gonna complain that a gym you pay $20 (or for the basic plan, $10!) a month for doesn't offer towels?! seriously?! bring your own! 

the locker room facilities are always clean and stocked-of course those automatic sinks are annoying af when they don't stay running and you have to quickly try to press it as hard as possible and hurry up and try to rinse (and repeat and repeat and repeat lol) but the sink to the far left stays running long enough, so i just use that one. again, no big deal. 

as far as a lack of friendliness and professionalism, get real-that is just a bold face lie. i am always greeted walking in and leaving. yesterday, 8\/9, there was an especially friendly girl working-she had a cute ""messy bun"" with curly hair, and was wearing a red collared shirt. my card didn't scan initially and she ran (literally) over and apologized, i rescanned and she told me to have a great workout-as i left, she (and a gentleman in a blue shirt) made it a point to say goodbye. 

this gym is incredible. it's huge and has every piece of equipment you could dream of. of course it gets busy\/crowded in the late morning and early evening (before\/after normal work hours), but it is what it is. if you don't like crowds or want to throw a temper tantrum about some trivial shit, go to globogym, run around in circles in the parking lot, or stay home-those negative vibes don't belong here.",5
"their customer service could use a great deal of improvement.  i bought some suits a few years ago and i've lost weight since then so i went in to take advantage of their ""free lifetime alterations."" the sales associate immediately tried laying the groundwork to sell me new suits and acted like they weren't going to be able to honor their alteration policy (which i was told when i bough the suits was all-inclusive, no-questions asked as long as i kept my rewards card). after the rude tailor kept whirling her fingers around, apparently wanting me to turn halfway around, she kept shaking her head and mumbling that new suits would be a better option.  one suit had some dog hair on it and she looked at me like i ran over her cat and told me to get it dry cleaned before she would even look at it.  for the other suit the ""free"" alteration was going to cost me $55 because ""nothing has ever been done with these stitches."" i'll be going to a tailor to get these suits altered and i'll never buy a suit from these people again.",1
"great!  fast breakfast lunch dinnermexican food. muy saboso!
i've grown-up in the southwest and know good mexican food when i find it. this place used to be called armando's but has recently changed hands, however the food is just downright tasty.the green sauce and red sauce are flavorful and just hot enough.anything with chicken is juicy and tender. the beans are cooked to perfection in. i haven't tried the breakfast barito selections yet. they do have green chilies from new mexico which is a real plus in arizonaso give this place a shot when you're working late at night and you need to get a quick fix in the neighborhood.",5

"we were so excited to try a restaurant at sls. what a letdown. terrible service. the waitress never came by the table after the food was brought out so we couldn't inform her that our burgers were cold and our orders were wrong. our drinks hadn't been refilled at all. you'd think at $8 a beer they'd at least offer to get you another one. i know they're new, but at $15 a burger, they should have great service to compensate.",1

"these guys are truly as good as it gets. they did a re-key and complete security install at my home. they were punctual, clean, and done before i knew it! best of all, the prices they offered for the installation and service were better than i could find anywhere else. my wife and i sleep well knowing our home and kids are protected by a fantastic security system. i recommend them to anyone. these guys are locally owned and operated.  great work.",5
the whose your daddy roll tasted like ammonia. the rice was also bad. i will never come here again.,1
"we have been wanting to check this spot out for a while. love the concept of farm to table. 
service was fantastic! server went the extra mile to accommodate the kiddos and my ice coffee request. 

we started our sunday brunch with chocolate and mochachino doughnuts. both were good but we liked the mochachino best. next up was the heritages popular deviled eggs. have to say we were a little disappointed. tried both the original and pimento. in my opinion it was missing something. needed a little kick. 

main course dishes we tried the buttermilk pancakes with maple syrup. delish! loved the light and airy texture with a nice crispy finish. house made jams and whipped butter served on the side. the risotto+scallops with roasted veggie dish was also tasty. enjoyed the fresh veggies and savory mix with the pecorino cheese. two of the four in our group enjoyed the fish and chips. north carolina trout served with a siracha sauce drizzled on the top. the vinegar in the coleslaw was a perfect compliment with the fish. nice way to round out the dish and balance out the flavors.   although we were stuffed we couldn't pass up the dessert. we opted for the chocolate chess pie. lovely presentation served with little dollops of chocolate and caramel and topped with fresh whipped cream. 

5 stars to heritage - we walked away happy and full. look forward to the next visit when i return to waxhaw.",5
"one of those restaurants where everything i ordered was very memorable.  it's kind of a hidden place in the same tiny strip mall that has had the cheapest (asian) hair cuts for 15+ years if you don't care how you look.

the decor didn't have anything to it, i took a photo of one of the rare items that make this place indicate any signs of being korean resto as well but now i look at it, it looks like its written in chinese.

fried dumplings, steam dumplings were absolutely a pleasure to consume.  we ordered battered deep-fried egglants which were nicely crispy and seasoned but eat it quickly fresh before it gets soggy.

my meal is not complete without a bowl of noodles!  cold korean noodle is quite refreshing and had a medium boil egg half on top.  the photo says it all, just as good as the ones i've had near steeles\/yonge.

this is one of the few places i would eat ""water cooked fish"" because i'm not big on spice.  the dish actually took awhile to come, so we figured that the chef actually went out to get a fresh fish.  nonetheless the fish was great and the spices wasn't overwhelming.  a non-spicy eater recommends it!",4
"pretty awesome experience.  mike is a fun dude that has put together an experience in vegas that you can't have without turnt up.  for the price you get every penny you pay.  free drinks, awesome clubs, no cover or waiting.  definately try this and i will be back!!",5
"woooooohooooo 100th review!!!  i eat here all the time, but i've gotta take the chance to be the 100th review.

although, a little over priced for pizza(imo), its damn good and honestly its not that bad $ wise.  also, they've added a few menu items that are all worth checking out.  not to mention they've done a few things to bring in the crowds.  a $3 pint night on mondays and i've heard they're doing a movie night as well.  don't know if they are kid friendly movies though.  a shrek\/nemo matinee when schools out for the summer would kill it.

this is probably the best kid friendly restaurant in town where the parents can actually eat good food and drink good booze.  the environment is very chill and the staff are quite cordial.  i highly recommend the shiitake pie or the cosmic karma but you can't really go wrong.

bottom line:  i feel like i could go on and on about this place but don't know that i need to, just check it out.  its a hippie themed pizza place with top notch ingredients, a kind vibe, a beautiful outdoor dining area, and overall sense of well being.

just know that the pies are made to order so be ready to wait 30-45 minutes+ when they are busy.  so grab a beer and app.",4
"miller barber shop not only offers an excellent haircut but a great experience as well. the facility is clean, the staff are friendly, and the service is second to none. the barbers give exceptional attention to even the minor details ensuring that you have a first class hair cut. individuals used to the mall style hair cut cattle calls are in for a real treat and you will be loathe to return to the corporate cookie cutter experience.  i happily frequent this establishment on a monthly basis.",5

"waitress doesn't speak english well enough to respond to questions. promised my daughter tempura chicken. the waitress brought out some thing else all together and my husband and i were almost done eating. my daughter just sat there and cried. then the manager explained that tempura chicken came on another menu. oh good to know, now that my daughter is hungry and crying at the end of the meal. totally :\/ willing to accommodate.",1
"i stayed here in summer 2013. the rooms are clean, if a little small compared with some places i have stayed in vegas. the staff at a four seasons is always really nice and professional. they offer you a small bottle of water when you check in;  yup, it's a first class joint alright. 

 i have to say the big draw for me was the pool. there are shady options at the pool, which is nice because a lot of vegas hotels force you to sit in the sun all day.(you can get a  partially shady spot at the mandalay bay beach too, maybe even for free if you are lucky, but you have to get there really early.)

 it never seems that busy at the pool  in the four seasons and  it's really pretty quiet all day. you can use mandalay beach if you that is what you prefer. i would  go over to the lazy river in the early morning when it's less crowded. then, i  would sit at the quiet four seasons  pool and relax until i was really hot in the mid afternoon (vegas in july is so hot it's more or less the off season).   they pass out free samples of the ""juice of the day"".  i bought one once because it was really good. they also give you free pitchers of water. i think overall, if you were going to rent a chair (and umbrella since those are extra) at mandalay bay beach to sit in a relatively quiet environment,  the free chairs, shade and  the quiet pool at the four seasons make it worth it, even if it is still more money.  

 i did feel a little weird, as i think i was the only adult staying there who brought an inner tube from home. (mine is really big and the prices they charge at mandalay bay are outrageous.) anyway, they were too classy to give me more than slightly surprised glances as i dragged my gigantic inner tube through their lobby. (the mandalay bay beach will blow up tubes for free, although  i've noticed they appreciate even a small tip, and since i am not paying through the nose for the tube i give them one.)

the restaurant in here is called the veranda and it's another one of those ""expensive, but not a waste of money"" type things. the food is really good overall, just as good as one of the chef owned places they have all over vegas. i loved the outdoor seating.  of course, since the four seasons is on the mandalay bay property you can also very easily eat in the large selection of restaurants there, or in the adjoining mall too, without even taking a cab.( one summer in vegas i was with someone who wanted to walk the strip. the glue on the shopping bag i was carrying melted causing it to fail mid-intersection.  now, i  usually cab it, unless it's really a short walk or getting dark.) in conclusion,  i had a really good experience at the four seasons and i would definitely stay there again.",5
"this place is classic, the food is great. the service is horrible, hence why it's getting 2 stars from me. i believe service to be a critical component of the dining experience. 

the manager is extremely rude and not at all accommodating. i tried to organize a dinner party for about 30 people here, the manager told me that he was unwilling to accommodate a party of our size during dinner. he said we could come at 5:30 or at 9 because our party would take up too much space and he had other patrons to think about. guess what manager, you just turned 30 people guaranteed to order 30 dinners... idiot. 

i've never been spoken to so rudely. i'll never come here again. there are several steakhouse in the las vegas area, no need to come to this one and be treated like crap.",2
"great food. my party each got a different dish and we all ended up sharing. we got the pork chops, ribs, pulled pork, chicken fried chicken. amazing. the band is great too. they play a lot of good songs and add a few touches to keep it interesting. i would recommend this place without a doubt. dessert was amazing too and the portions are generous. the banana bread pudding is out of this world. our waiter was also very funny, friendly, and very prompt.",5
"the customer service at this place is awful. my friend and i booked this room about a month ago for a well-deserved girls weekend. we checked in around 5pm. i asked if there were any available upgrades and the man at the front desk replied no. we found that very hard to believe considering there were very few people at the pool, restaurant and cars in the parking lot. the guy was just being a lazy a*s and likely didn't want to take the extra minute or two to move us to a different room.

once we got to our room we called down to ask for a refrigerator to be placed in our room for medication. the same guy answered the phone with another response of no. i think that is the only word in this guys vocabulary.

the next day we went to the restaurant for breakfast. we were sat by a very rude host, and were one of two tables in the restaurant. we just got done working out and left to wash our hands. on our way out we ran in the waitress and asked if she was our waitress so we could give her our drink order. she seemed incredibly confused as she didn't know if she was our waitress, yet she was the only one there waiting tables. it took forever to get our food and my eggs came out a color i have never seen. i also needed a knife to cut my eggs...also a first.

we then went to the pool. we were all alone for two hours until another group showed. once they showed there were two servers to take their food and beverage order. not once did either of these servers ask how we were and if we needed anything. i guess fine by me as we brought our own beers and food even though the signs said we couldn't. if we would have waited for them we would have died of heat stroke.

the saloon wasn't open (we were told it had been closed for months), no ice machine near our room, our room smelled of old-ness, the decor was dated, bulbs burnt out in the bathroom, no shade at the pools when it was extremely hot, only two pool towels per room with the threat of a $50 charge per missing towel (i could buy the same towel at walmart for $8)....this place was terrible and we will never go back!

the only decent customer service we had was from edgar. he was the one who checked us out and was very nice and seemed to care of our terrible time. he did the best he could considering our stay was over. he gave us each two free drink coupons but they will never be used as we will never go back!",1

"i'm giving golden buddha four stars because they serve solid dim sum that is as good as i can find in the valley.  i brought my parents here when they terrorized *ahem* i mean visited me a few weeks ago.  my parents were surprised that it wasn't too expensive and were happy, although not impressed, with the dishes.  this place is a million times better than c-fu, where they add a disturbing amount of food coloring to their chicken feet.  

also, i want to give a shout-out.  there is a waitress here with long hair who is exceptionally helpful when you are looking for a particular dish to eat.  she always goes out of her way for me to find the right cart, or grabs the food straight from the kitchen in a timely manner.  thank you, long-haired waitress, for that! :)",4

"now i do not know if i am as thrilled with farmers. their customer service is good and they do take care of you but their accident forgiveness is a scam. i moved and my rates actually went down for the area. before moving i had an accident which should not have affected the rate., especially since the rates when down when i moved. when my policy renewed, however, the rates went up 40 a month!!! farmers could give me no reason why. no one else's in my area did. in addition to this i was told that i was getting a discount to bundle my renter's insurance. it was a lie too. when i canceled the renters insurance my rate stayed the same. i was also getting charged a fee for receiving a paper bill which i was never given the option to do otherwise or even told about the fee. i am now doubting the honesty of this company but stay because they do take care of you in an accident or an issue. just make sure you ask lots of questions and get things in writing!!!!",2

"this is a review of the food only.

dropped by here today for restaurant week but also ordered off the happy hour menu.

started with cocktail shrimp, which were decent size and pretty fresh. then tomato soup... which i can't decide if i like it. there wasn't much flavor to it. the filet minion, which i asked for medium rare, but was more medium. a bit chewy but had a burnt taste to parts of it. came with mashed potatoes and spinach. overall the main course was alright.

from the happy hour menu, had the zuchinni fries, which had no flavor and were huge chunks. the server saw we didn't care for this and automatically removed this from the bill. also had the truffle mac n cheese balls, which sounded awesome, but lacked flavor. there was no cheese flavor at all. no truffle flavor. bland. and the ""sloppy joe"" sliders. how deceiving! it was a regular slider with cheese, and also lacked flavor, and had no sauce in it. 

desserts were better. fried oreos with ice cream... can't really go wrong with that. and ny cheesecake, not as dense as it usually is.. kinda fluffy which is nice.

overall, food was all bland. but!! our server, heath was amazing. he was very nice, professional, and on top of everything. he deserves 5 stars. if i ever do go back, it would be because he is a good server.",2

"my wife got me to sign up. i've gone to about 8+ sessions (just over a week now). i only see a small difference physically so far but i feel significantly better which is my personal goal. i want to feel fit and perform outdoor activities easier and go for a run without heaving heavily at the end... so far so good. no complaints. i burn anywhere from 850 - 950 calories each session. the rowing and treadmill portions are generally the same and it can be easy to get bored with the treadmill in particular but they both have their place in the overall workout and are beneficial as they keep the heart rate up before\/after you do the dynamic exercises in the bench room. there is always a dynamic element to each session as each trainer has their own routine for the workout room which are essentially total-body workouts but tend to have a focus on abs, legs, cardio, etc depending on the trainer. each trainer has their own selection of music also which keeps the overall experience fresh. the customer service is great and the trainers are very helpful if you have questions. good experience this far.
------------------

update: they are under new management and make cancellation impossible - my wife has been trying to cancel for a few months now and they keep ""forgetting"" to call back. 

we have gone in several times and the first time they stated they no longer utilize cancellation forms and that a manager would need to perform the cancellation. the  manager never seems to be in and never calls us back and we have been charged 3 times now since we originally tried to cancel my wife's membership. 

also now they have delayed even more by emailing a cancellation form to fill out (even though we filled one out in person); and this is after they told us that they supposedly no longer utilize cancellation forms. until they change such practices, avoid this branch.",1
"the food is good! i get the fried catfish with collard greens and mac & cheese. the catfish is just perfectly fried every time. the sweet tea is very good and very sweet. the tea is never consistent when i go, but still good. the big problem i have is the parking at this place. it is so hard to find a spot in front of the restaurant. also sometimes the hostesses can be rude and forget that you are waiting.",3
"i always wonder why people go to a discount airline, are aware of the fees for certain baggage, buy their ticket and then complain about the inconvenience.  i first flew frontier in december 2015 and it was easy and at a great price.  the cost was about half of united and all the other airlines.

the second flight was june 2016 from cle to las.  the flight was supposed to be at 7:45 am but after we arrived at the airport, they said that there was some problem with the airplane and that there would be a delay of 6-7 hours.... ouch!  i have access to the united club, so i was able to work and relax there, but 7 hours is too long of a delay.  they did give a $10 voucher for food (i was able to use it in the las vegas airport) and later they gave a $100 credit good for another flight booked within 90 days.

all in all, the flight are fine. the price is amazing.  the delay was really a big problem, but not the end of the world.  i bought a backpack that conforms to their ""personal item"" restrictions and have not ever paid other fees or penalties about which so many complain.  the seats are not the most comfortable but four hours is not so bad to tolerate it. i am 6'4"" and 240 lbs, so i would complain if i could.",4

cons: i'm really big fan of pearl milk tea, but honestly, gongcha royal milk tea i can't taste any milk or tea. it just tasted like water. i was really dispointed. definitely not going back again.",1

"heard great reviews about this place from a co-worker..its her and her husband's favorite place to dine in vegas so i thought i'd go check it out..she was right about how great this place was! reasonable price for exceptional food..my boyfriend and i both got the pre-fixe (1 appetizer, entree and dessert). he ordered a belgium beer and i got a pineapple mojito (yum!)..some of the drinks at the bar were i think 50% off during happy hour times..also it was ladies night (wednesday) so my dinner was 50% off which you really can't go wrong with! the staff was very attentive as they asked if we had any allergies or any foods that we did not enjoy-which i thought was a thoughtful question.

before we got our appetizers, the staff brought out an amuse bouche which looked like a small quiche..my bf got nervous that this was the size of the meals..silly boy haha..it was quite yummy! they also give you complimentary bread, a potato roll and a chocolate roll..both delicious-i prefered the chocolate roll, the potato roll was a bit too salty but was still great. 
for my appetizer, i ordered the bbq shrimp and maytag coleslaw and my bf ordered the veal sweetbreads..i loved the shrimp, it was delicious..and usually i'm not a big fan of bbq sauce but this had a bit of tang to it which really complemented the blue cheese maytag coleslaw..my bf ordered the veal sweetbreads and i was not a fan of the taste or texture..he liked it so i guess at least one of us enjoyed it.
for the main entree, i ordered the rack of lamb and my bf had ordered the duck confit..we were both getting super full from the appetizers (pretty big portions) that i could only eat one piece of lamb..i really enjoyed it as it was on top of a bed of quinoa and veggies..my bf enjoyed his duck confit as well..
for dessert, i ordered the coconut bread pudding and my bf ordered the banana cheesecake..we were both so stuffed from the meals that we only had a few bites as it was also accompanied by 3 assortment of cookies..the desserts were okay, if i had the choice, i wouldn't of ordered the dessert again but hey, to each their own.

this restaurant was great, even though like everyone has said, its in such a random location quite far from the strip..the only reason i put a 4 out of 5 was because of dessert as well as it being quite far from the strip..it was about a $37 cab ride including tip which almost came out to a meal in it of itself..if it were closer or you have a car, i would definitely recommend it more. overall, great service, good food, good experience!",4
"i think the santa fe mining company is on par with what you'd expect from a decent neighborhood bar. it has a couple pool tables, a dart board, shuffleboard, a touch tunes juke box, and a few arcade games. what sets this shit aside is the mellow atmosphere, coupled with one of the best bartenders i've seen around town. rob really takes care of you, and manages the bar well. the service he provides is second to none, and that is why i will keep going back.",4
"soooo yummy!t
the wait was long on a saturday at 10am but worth it! (40 minutes) 
we got the oreo smores pancakes (my fave) 
wild berry crepes, and banana cream french toast. 
and a vegetarian omelet to break up the sweet! 
all huge portions-- although the pancakes, french toast, and crepes do not come with a ""side"" of anything. 

this was the best breakfast we had on vacation. :)",5
"this place is a hidden gem!  i went there 3 times.  1st time, no one.  2nd time, a couple tables were taken.  last time, it was almost packed.

great variety of szechuan and spicy food.  it's cheap and delicious.  the staff (lady) is super friendly and she speaks french, english and mandarin.

one of the best chinese place in montreal in my opinion.

a must try.",5
"i came here because morton's was closed during a weekday. i had always wanted to stop in because i had heard good things. was not impressed, the only thing that help me manage to finish my food was the 4 glasses of johnny walker blue i had. weird layout for what should be a fancy place.",3
"this was my first trip to vegas, i wanted a nice hotel, but wanted a little younger crowd then i thought the bellagio might have. honestly, this hotel is worth the cost. it's a modern hotel, two pools, and a very expansive casino. we stayed in the west tower and paid for a terrace view. the room was great, soft and comfortable bed, down comforter, marble bathroom sinks and massive shower, as well as bathtub. good location in the middle of the strip, free parking, and nice view. the room does have a mini fridge, but there's little storage for things like leftovers and drinks as it is full of the typical costly minibar items. the staff was always helpful and friendly. i liked the wicked spoon buffet, exceptional desserts and prime rib, the buffet was more expensive then the bellagio but higher quality. i'll be staying here again.",4
"i read a review that said it was a mix of young and old, so my boyfriend my self and a friend went to give it a shot.  we walk in and we were the young.  that said we still had a great time. the bartenders are friendly (when do you ever meet a nice bartender), the older crowd is still ok because everyone is so polite and kind.  it's a great place to listen to some country tunes and get away from the hostility of uppidy, 'guido' downtown nightclubs.",3
"adorable little market with a good selection of things. candy, snacks, food type items, and pre-made lunches. the workers there are very polite and helpful. and yes, if you were wondering, they *do* have redbean pastries in the freezer, ""taiyaki"" yess!!",5
great broth! very authentic with a ton of flavor! great thai tea as well. service is fast and attentive. usually busy but haven't yet had a problem being seated right away!,5
"we received a response on the same day and we scheduled the next business day. knowledgeable, reasonably priced and great customer service. would highly recommend!!",5
"seafood in az is always a dodgy proposition; very happy we came by. good fried shrimp (my 6 yr old's dinner), hush puppies where light and tasty. as an east coaster reading that they had new england clam chowder got by bs radar going, but it was very nice. warm and think, light clam flavor, definitely a reorder but next time bread bowl baby!

whoa mahi-mahi taco, really the highlight order. it was big, the fish was cooked right (still moist), and some sort of sauce that was a knockout. really good on the fish.",5
$20 pedicure...the worst i ever had....the lady was so rough and rushed through the whole thing...instead of relaxing after a long week i was nervous and anxious the whole time. it was so bad i felt like walking out.,1
dutch bros knows how to treat their employees! anyone who lives here knows that being outside in the heat for more than 5 mins is absolutely awful. dutch keeps their employees from going out in the heat and taking orders between certain hours. i'm definitely willing to wait longer for my coffee so that these broistas don't have to stand outside!,5
this review is strictly for hostess.  we had a group of seven but one of our party is a very large man so we asked for a table for 8.  she said ok but then made it a joke shout out friend.  we decided to still have breakfast but it will be our last visit.  we have been coming here for years and they have just lost a good customer because of a hostess's decision to be disrespectful.  which is something that is just not acceptable.  oh.  in the off chance there is some confusion as to why we will not return?  wendy is the reason.  rudeness will not be tolerated.  you are in a service industry and she should be very aware of her surroundings!  i am sure she did not intend for my wife and her friend to hear her however they did.  sorry ronnie's.,1
this is my second time here and i have to say it's one the best hakka places i've been to in a long time. their chicken pakoras are really good! my favourite dish is their chili beef\/chicken both with sauce and dry! their chowmein noodles are really good as well.  the staff is friendly and both times that i have been here it has been quite busy. you may have to wait a few minutes longer then you'd like for your food but it's totally worth it.,5
"second visit, and the overall experience was just great.

i guess they could hire one more waiter\/waitress, as the place got kinda busy with only one waiter.",4
"i first encountered pace print when i was attempting to produce a large amount of flyers for a student society i am involved with.

rushing into pace print, i asked the very friendly and helpful member of staff what i thought was going to be an impossible task - i needed 400 flyers in two days. amazingly enough, pace print was able to do it with no trouble at all, which was a pleasent suprise.

however the cost of this was pretty high and i felt that if it were not for the speed that i needed the flyers, and i had had a chance to shop around, i would not have chosen pace print.

for more personal use, pace print offers printers that specialise in party invertations etc and business cards - even t-shirts.

unfortunatly the price of all this is still expensive, and while the service is fast and friendly, the cost of all this is too much.",3
"these guys did an amazing job! we just moved into a new house and we had them mount 5 tvs! very impressed with the results and the professionalism of the crew. yes, the crew. with that many tvs, jason and a crew was sent to minimize the time. it was awesome! i definitely recommend them. also, they are expanding to other states, so keep an eye out!",5
i need to cancel my membership asap and get my money bank! stupid facility is a fucking joke! the machines are always broken! the showers smell like shit! the water fountain is always giving hot water! let's not forget how stupid and lazy the employees are! 5 years of paying a platinum membership for crap service! golds gym needs to come back and get rid of all these eos lame fucks!,1
"if i could give it a zero, i would. it took nearly 20 minutes get water.  then, after an hour wait, my husband was served frozen enchiladas. absolutely terrible. don't go here.",1
"prices here are what you would expect from a college bookstore- high, but they do have pretty much everything you may need, from meds to pencils and calculators, snacks, and shirts, notebooks and even magazines and used, low priced movies. 
books are what they are- expensive.
the only issue i have with this place is the fricken lines. why are we constantly changing the way the lines work here? one semester the line is over there, the next semester it is on the other side of the room, and forced behind the book shelves so anyone just coming in cannot see it. stop being so bipolar with the lines!
other than that, it is a pretty decent place, and the return policies are pretty cool.",3
"jasmine signed me up for a room and i was pretty excited about the price and i'm happy that i finally found a clean room but it was very disappointing that as she was ringing me up, all of a sudden she mentioned i had to pay for insurance. great whatever, but then when she told me my total, there was a $24 start up fee, which i know is normal- but hey. mention that before we start making plans for me to drop a couple hundred bucks in your facility. appreciative of finally finding a clean room in such a run down area though.",2
"yes, this place is expensive. however, the food, service, and ambiance (but mainly the food) is well worth it. i especially love how the staff explains each dish to you if you've never had it before.

what we ordered:

aburi beef carpaccio: salty, thinly sliced beef that goes well with the soft poached egg quarters and pear.

miku roll: a must try classic with a great combination of flavors. i would choose the oshi sushi plates or the red wave roll over it though because we couldn't remember the miku roll after the other two.

aburi oshi plate: essentially a sampler plate of the three other oshi sushi plates (2 pieces of sushi from each of the three other oshi ones). i recommend trying this to get a nice diversity of tastes before going on to order a full plate of your favorite.

red wave roll: my favorite. it melts in your mouth in a soul-satisfying way (slightly dramatic but you'll agree with me when you try it).",5
"i had a great time here and the only complaint i got was the place being too small for the amount of people they let in. the music was great, a lot of attractive people and everyone seemed to be having a blast. we got bottle service which came with nice comfy seats that fits four in front of one of the pools. for the boos, we got blended redbull vodka which was bomb! never had it blended before.. the strawberry vodka was also refreshing and tangy.

if you want to party daytime, this is one spot you want to hit up.",4

"ordered veggie lo mien w\/extra veggies only to receive a greasy, bland dish with very little veg. fiancé ordered singapore noodles only to get a mass of bland, boring noodles, without much meat or veg.  egg roll, wonton soup and veg soup all equally under-whelming.",1
"very honest and more than fair in pricing! when i called to set an appointment steve the owner answered the phone.  steve came to my house the next day to check my heater for possible co 2 leak. he found everything to be safe and in great condition.  two days prior i had a large company in the valley lie to me about a crack in my furnace and a co 2 leak.  it's the company that advertises, no melvin's.  whatever you do please call steve and don't bother calling any other company.  he is honest and knows his business!",5
"my all time favorite breakfast\/brunch place. their atmosphere is friendly and inviting, just like the staff. the food is simple but full of flavor! by far the best sausage gravy i found in vegas. i am always bringing new people here to share the love!",5
"i'll be honest...i was looking for einstein brothers bagels, and didn't find them right away, so i decided to stop in here.  it actually turned out to be a good decision!

there was one man working the joint.  i went with an everything bagel with cream cheese, and a garlic bagel, plain.  total for both bagels was a little under $4.00.  not bad..not bad at all.  here is how they were..........

everything bagel with cream cheese-  first of all, this was a big ass bagel!  when i unwrapped the white paper, i was impressed!  this thing had a ton of cream cheese on it and was cut in half so that it gave you 4 quarter slices of bagel to enjoy.  the everything bagel had the usual poppy seeds\/garlic\/salt etc on the outside and was incredibly tasty.  the outside had a nice crunch to it and the inside was nice and chewy.  i detected a hint of sourdough, too (might use a sourdough starter for their bread?  whatever it was, it was delicious!)! this was one mighty fine bagel.  probably the best bagel i have had in the phoenix area since moving out here permanently.  

garlic bagel-  delicious!  lot's of garlic salt\/pieces on it.  crunchy outside, chewy inside, just like the everything bagel. 

overall, i was happy i ""got lost"" and found this place.  it is a bit hard to find (behind bank of america, next to starbucks on the corner of bell & grand), but it is worth the search to locate it.  these bagels were really good, prices were fair, service was to the point and it's a locally run business.  i'll be back soon enough!",4
"while roadtripping from iowa to california, we decided to stop at a few places featured on diners, drive-ins and dives, to see if they were worth the fuss.  this place, i'm sorry to say, was not.  we travelled about 20 miles out of our way to eat here, and we were disappointed.  we got there a bit late for lunch, which might explain why our food all seemed reheated, and insufficiently.  pulled pork and sliced brisket were both lukewarm at best and slightly rubbery as though they had been reheated.  beer battered fries were cold, and so nearly inedible (would have probably been very tasty if hot and fresh).
the place was also located in a mall parking lot in an old, cheesy 50s style diner, and the decor and location were underwhelming.  i prefer my bbq places to be authentic hole-in-the-wall type places with a more rustic ambience.  the food and the atmosphere of a good bbq place should remind us that there's a smokestack going out back - here, i found that very hard to believe.",2
"let me start off by saying: wow! very rare that you get customer service like my dad and i received today. we walked in and were greeted as soon as we stepped in, the young gentleman (tony) helping us was polite, knowledgeable, and very personable. he asked all the right questions to make sure he could give my dad the discounts he was eligible for, was thorough in his explanations, and was very efficient. we were in there for a short time and he activated 2 lines for us, made sure all of our needs were addressed, and had us on our way. not directly related to me but he was also very nice to the t-mobile representative he had to call as part of the process. all around great store with great customer service, strongly recommend!",5
"was here this past monday. the quality of the tea is amazing. this guys knows tea, and is serious and passionate about it. peter (the owner) took a great deal of time to explain the different teas, and made sure that we sampled all of them. speaking with him was the highlight of my day.",5
great gym been coming here since dec when they just opened up this is a fantastic gym clean well equipped and great staff yes there's very buzy times you may have to wait a bit to use something but what i usually do instead of waiting there like some dumb people is i go use something else and then come back .overall it's a great gym i just wish they will soon have one closer to where i live( newmarket) since now i have to drive quite a bit.,5
"i went with my friends for brunch new years and this place was nicely packed, the wait wasn't that long. i ordered the whole hog omelette and it was good and meaty. it was a huge portion size; i couldn't finish the whole thing. the bar harbour flapjacks were really delicious too with their berry puree to top it off. my friend got the bird, the other omelette i was thinking about ordering, and he gave me a taste of it and i knew i should have ordered that. it was really good. i'll be sure to order that next time i go there.",4
hotel was alright. the rate wasn't too cheap and it wasn't really worth it in my opinion. i hate that the parking structure is so far away and you have to walk through the miracle mile shops. i would recommend people just driving to where valet\/check-in is and have someone from your group take the luggage while you drive and park. that way you don't have to lug your luggage all over the shops. once you enter the door that is where the hotel check in is.,3
"i drive by this starbucks everyday on the way to work - it is so convenient! while the parking lot is small, the drive thru is always available and not hard to get into at all. the baristas working the drive thru are always helpful and fast-paced. i've had my drink made incorrectly once, but they had no problem fixing it for me when i brought it up. the baristas also take the time to get to know you, it really brightens up my day with how friendly they are.

i highly recommend this location, it's my favorite!",5
"they get two stars for effort. hubby wanted to try it out since it was all you can eat. except it's not as they only have a small selection of items to choose from. we were there on a monday evening so perhaps it's a shorter version of what's usually on? but i guess i'll never know. the place seems to be popular for their thalia's as that's what the people that came around the same time were having. i mean it's definitely the best bang for your buck. we took the all you can eat like gluttons but didn't really enjoy what we got. the photo i took was of the lunch menu but it's the same for the dinner and the price is 17.96$. so i ordered a tandoori, butter chicken and naan. the tandoori was chewy and not made in a clay oven. the butter chicken was okay and i think the naan was best of the 3. hubby ordered the pakoras which he enjoyed, along with palak paneer and beef vindaloo which he didn't enjoy and suffered through. they don't include tea in their ""a volonté"" which i think is a shame. overall we paid 50$after tax and tip and literally had food worth 10$. so not worth it at all! probably won't go back here",2
i called up for an inspection towards the end of the month and they had no trouble squeezing me in. staff was friendly and helpful. i plan to come back next year.,5
"pizzeria bianco is a true, neapolitan style pizzeria that uses a wood-fires brick oven in order to create a great pizza.  it's a true gem in phoenix, a place you need to visit if you're on vacation or if you're a local

my overall rating - 4  1\/2 stars (atmosphere, service, food, return)

atmosphere - pizzeria bianco is in a beautiful brick building.  there is outdoor seating, and during the sunset the building lights up and it creates a great atmosphere.  be warned, it's small so expect a long wait during busy times.  inside you should make your way over to view wood fired brick oven, wear fresh pizzas are baked in minutes. 1 star.

service - we visited on an early sunday evening, and they were certainly busy.  we chose to sit outside in the beautiful phoenix outdoors.  the staff was very accommodating to our large group.  it was slow at times, but i'm pretty sure that's due to their popularity.  nonetheless it was a good experience.  1 star.

food - if you're a fan of neapolitan pizza, pizzeria bianco will not disappoint.  this style of pizza uses freshly tossed dough to create a thin crust that gets baked in about a minute in their oven.  the result is a pizza that's pure in taste and allows the toppings to star.  our choices included the biancoverde - a white pizza with prosciutto and the wiseguy - sausage & caramelized onions.  if you're a fan of prosciutto you'll love it.  the caramelized onions on the wiseguy were sweet and fit well with the sausage.  i even ordered a latte after seeing an espresso machine.  even that was good.  it's some of the best neapolitan style pizza i've had.  2 stars.

will i return? - probably not.  while the pizza is superb, you do have to fight the crowds.  pizzeria bianco is not the only neapolitan style pizzeria i've been to.  it's great though, and is worth a visit if you've never been. 1\/2 stars.

my yelp rating scale (sum of all parts):
1 star - atmosphere - is it a cool dive?  perhaps an upscale place?  no matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and i'll give a star if i like it or thinks it has great charm.
1 star - service - you can have a great meal with bad service.  but that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  it's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.
2 stars - food - i'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.
1 star - will i come back? - if i know for a fact i'll return, i'll give this a star. a place has to make an impression for me to return. 

each category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because i consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  i will sum them up to provide my final yelp score.",4
"i took my 85-year old mom to ho-chunk. she put $100 bill into a machine. it gave her a $5 credit. she immediately pushed the button for help. people came, but they had every excuse that they couldn't check the machine. it ruined her evening. she so loves her little bit of fun gambling. this experience robbed her of that. i am furious! we will never return. i should have read the reviews for ho-chunk. very bleak.",1

delicious food.  friendly staff.  and you cannot beat the price.  the french toast was especially good.,5
"the locals love this place. it is one of those places that you just know someone will suggest for lunch in either dilworth or uptown.

it is good- don't get me wrong. i like the pizza with pear on it (trust me). the crust is thin- the way i personally prefer. the salads are fresh. the outdoor area in dilworth is nice.

it is a bit overpriced though and i will never understand the undying love that the locals have for it (really- there is a huge fan club)",4
"most food at the roaming fork has been very good. however the 12 hours smoked ribs should be named 12 hours of misery! ribs were totally sub par and i was up all night. fortunately i only ate 1\/3rd of the portion, the other 2\/3rd's were tough and tasted funky!",2
"i want to give this place 2 stars due to sheer proximity to my house but i can't for a few reasons. 

the location itself should be convenient for me especially considering the large parking lot however my experiences here have always been less then pleasant. the staff appear to either be children or poorly trained, giving off a very unwelcome vibe to me every time i've attempted to shop here. 
my most recent trip was actually the worst and will likely be the last time i visit this location. i will state again that i often look a little bummish and did so today; i came in to grab a treat (delicious pumpkin cheesecake, i was too lazy to travel to metro ;) and while there test some moisturizers i'm thinking of possibly switching to. my boyfriend grabbed the cheesecake while i told him i was going to check out the moisturizer i wanted to look at where we converged for him to impatiently await my comparison process.

as i am testing the two products on my hand the cosmetics lady asks me if i need help but i explain i'm just looking .... so she starts to hound me a bit. stands right over my shoulder and asks me if i use the brand to which i replied i do that's why i'm testing another product from the line to see which i want to buy. but the way she loomed over me truly made me so uncomfortable that after a few seconds i just thought it would be better to pick the product up at my usual 24hr location (6 points plaza) it is way more convenient schedule wise, 10pm close time is too early for me. and the most important thing, the staff at the other location knows me so they look past my frumpy appearance knowing how much i spend. the staff at this location in particular could really use some work, even the young cashier had a bizarre attitude about her... it's hard to place but i find the customer service in general to be very lack luster.

out of desperation i may shop here but that's all it will ever be and i won't expect to be treated with respect if i do",1
"i'll be honest, i only came for the dim sum! me and a friend ordered one of everything on their $3 menu. and some of it, like the pork bun&shumai& shrimp ball, were good. others, i have to say, were just delightfully adequate! that golden sand bun, i just had no taste for, but i have been here before for various chicken dishes which were really good! so i have to recommend!

however, the service we received was really slow. it must have taken nearly 30 minutes to get dessert and the check after being done with our dishes, but that would be the only setback for me not visiting again!",4
"always consistent. if a restaurant can't nail down consistency...what's the point? knowing what you're getting when you go is a plus. 

this place has been here for a long time. there used to be a popo's too on the east side until it sadly closed down. my sister and i were not happy campers. but low and behold the original is still alive and well and kickin' great dishes exactly like they did on the east side! again, consistency. the owner is always present and taking checks, seating guests and that again is an added bonus. everything is fresh, the rice is great, unlike most places here where it's just starchy and gross and the medium salsa is always yummy. request the hot salsa as well...it's not overly hot and quite frankly not sure why it's their ""hot"" salsa but regardless-it's deliscious. i had the el pollo especial except i ordered it not fried and with machaca beef...and they were of course accomodating. the jalepeno cream cheese they top it with is well, excessive, however a little goes along way and i'll be eating the other half for dinner. 

if you get the opportunity to go, go. the margaritas are also quite yummy and who can go wrong with $.99 ritas for happy hour. just wish they were closer to scottsdale!",4
"i've been here several times during lunch (i work just around the corner), and am always impressed.  the rewards card is outstanding- nothing makes my day more than when they tell me i have a free drink or free pastry waiting for me!  i've tried multiple bagels, sandwiches, and salads and always been impressed.  having the calories posted right on the items is also fantastic for those of us who want to know what we're putting into our bodies.

my only complaint is that their menu is exceedingly high in salt content, but it's hard to find a restaurant that isn't these days.  definitely 5 stars!",5
"overall impression:
nice interior and service, but we were sick afterward, and felt we definitely paid too much for the quality we got.  overall, i'll never go back. 

details below

interior:
-very spacious 
- good amount of space between hot and cold tables, meaning few bottleneck areas
-open unprotected table with raw meat, meant to be used for fresh cooked stir fry. presents great possibility for health hazards

service:
-very friendly and kind
-drinks are self serve however

value:
-it cost us about $30 a person before gratuity
-they charge an extra $10 if they think you've been wasteful with food. not unheard of, but makes you nervous when spitting something gross into a napkin, which we did a lot
-soft drinks and water are included

food - the good:
-sushi better than any other buffet sushi we've had
-asian beef stew was tender and flavourful
-chicken balls were among my top 5
-broccoli beef, also very flavourful and savoury
-good variety of ice cream
-mini pancakes were a hit

food - the not so good:
-pork ribs were very salty and rather chewy
-jello wasn't good, rubbery and bland

food - the inedible:
-the pork was all grease and tasted like cooking oil despite the sauce
-the crispy duck was chewy with skin like a rubber band
-the breaded items(chicken, scallops, onion rings) were all very chewy as well
-the fried noodles were extremely greasy and tasted only of cooking oil

we left feeling sick and it only got worse into the night. we were so concerned about the food wasting fee that we probably ate more than we should have of the inedible chewy and greasy food. 

i got the impression that the food had been sitting out since lunch for how stale it tasted.

i wanted to try the fresh cooked stir fry, but couldn't bring myself to do it after eating the other food there. since i was pretty sure much of what i'd eaten had been sitting out much of the day, i didn't trust the salad-bar-like table of raw meat with no sneeze guard or barriers. i also didn't like the idea of piling the raw items on a plate and carrying it across the aisle to the cooks(whom the meat should have been kept with to prevent mishaps or accidents or tampering).  that portion of the restaurant is badly designed, and for all its novelty, presents too much potential for something to go wrong.

in the end, my wife and i paid $60 before gratuity to be sick for the night.  i don't recommend this  restaurant.",2
"if you go to lgo grocery on a sunday morning for breakfast or brunch and you see the parking lot is full and there is a line out the door, please don't turn around and go some where else, please! you will not be disappointed with the wait! or just pass it by so there is one less person in front of me!!! 

the quality of food is untouchable! okay, really their homemade english muffins are what is untouchable! try the commuter sandwich, yes it is on one of their amazing homemade english muffins. if you have been to lgo next door for a meal, then you know the quality of the food is top notch, well there is nothing disappointing about their grocery!

oh and please don't forget to pick up a tammy coe red velvet cupcake, they are the best i have had to date! the cupcakes can be found in the glass case below the menus. and they are full of the most divine treats you will come across.

lgo grocery you are truly amazing and addictive. i find myself making excuses to pass by, just so i can stop in for some tasty treats.",5

spend your money here. you'll be glad you did.

ps, thanks lanikai and alena. :d",5
"miserable. 

our attempts at ordering were thwarted by a server with no knowledge of the menu. in his defense he was a hipster who had *only* been working there two months and apparently doesn't care about *anything* especially being able to do his job. 

our attempts at ordering were further thwarted by a chef\/cook who was either unwilling or unable to create the first four items we tried to order. the fifth item ordered was the $22 polish sampler - which had 1 gołbaki, 3 pierogies and 1 polish sausage. we were informed the pierogies would all be of the same type (flavor\/filling) and would be the cook's choice, additionally the type of sausage was unknown. not very reassuring if your polish place can't tell you the difference between kielbasa and kabanos.

we finally settled on a pierogi appetizer, an order of gołbaki, and the jäger schnitzel. regarding the pierogi - the menu says ""we have different types of flavors everyday so please ask our friendly staff!"" - we tried but were unable to find the friendly staff, so we asked our server (who didn't have a clue).

the pierogi selections were all potato filled, including the cheese one. 
the pierogi aren't any better than the frozen mrs. t brand at every grocer.
the gołbaki was an unspecified ground meat wrapped in cabbage with plain tomato paste covering it. the jäger schnitzel might have been good, had it *any* seasoning - even just a little salt.

in summary, if you're seeking a good authentic polish food restaurant - keep looking, this ain't it.",1
"come here often for a quick lunch. the staff is amazing and very friendly. they have wifi and a great selection of coffees and teas. 

as for food they have a lot of healthy breakfast and snack options with a couple sandwiches as well. they do have vegan options for most of their selections. 

the space is a little tight inside as many folks come with laptops or to read. there are couches, comfy chairs, low and high tables. they do have outdoor seating, which works now that the weather agrees. they also have a reading selection.

all in all, a great place for breakfast or lunch for the coffee aficionado or health nut. seating can get cramped during peak times, but otherwise is comfy. food quality is high and great vegan options. great place for a quick grab or relax.",4
very delicious place definitely love the large portion sizes.  our server was very nice and fast. first time visiting for my husband and i . got seated right away and food came out quickly we ordered the hot stone pork so big with sides and a delicious steamed egg we also ordered two sushi rolls a philly roll and las vegas  roll so big we had to get it to go. will definitely  be back :),4
"awful hospital. friend's husband had a stroke and is severely affected.  noone seems to give a crap or have humanistic feelings.  nurses were awful. doctors did not make an effort of informing patient's family of even a stroke he ended up having one day when no family member was there.  noone bothered to communicate what happened, nurses vaguely referring to it as a seizure.  this stroke left him completely unable to talk, write, paralyzed on left side etc.  confusing and contradictory info was given.  initially he was admitted to the hospital w a smaller stroke and had a stent put into his carotid.  i don't think they did a good job of figuring out what caused the stroke so that future ones could be prevented.  nothing again was communicated to the family.  i could go on and on about many other things which happened.  all i will say is research a hospital and go where it atleast better than this useless hospital. shame on them.",1
"the food is okay ( i use to life in southern ca)  but the prices were crazy, it's is so overpriced",3
"boralia is a truly unique dining experience with ingredients and flavours you probably won't find anywhere else. still they strive to make each dish delicious and beautifully presented. for that reason i am giving it 5 stars. 

i went there on a saturday night. walked in at 7 pm with no reservation and was seated at the bar. by 7:30 the restaurant was full. i suggest making a reservation if you want to come here. 

we had: 

whelk - 5\/5 a grilled sea snail with a texture similar to calimari, served with an incredible sauce

elk - 4\/5 beautifully prepared. slightly tough. but it's elk. elk is tough. 

pigeon pie - 5\/5 this was the standout dish. the crust is incredible. the pigeon breast on the side was heavenly. 

stuffed onions - 5\/5 grilled onions stuffed with creamed carrot. this is a fantastic vegetarian option or side dish. 

desert:

syllabub cake - 5\/5 a super light lemon pound cake with almond slivers and blueberries on top. yum",5
"after my review the store manager, nick, reached out to me to understand the situation i had dealt with at hyde park. i mention to him my frustration about who was dealing with the insurance company and how i did a lot of the leg work and paid out of pocket for my repair. nick apologized for the way the paper work was handled and mention it is not the correct procedure. he ensured that if i do not see a check from the insurance company to contact him. i feel better knowing the employees have been retrained on how to handle insurance repairs. thank you nick for taking the time to explain the correct procedures of the process and to advise that next time i won't have to go through this.",4
"truly awful
tired fishy mushy omakase 
just dreadful

"my wife and i stopped by to look around at some of the suv's cbb had on hand. we were met by cj who helped us look at a few vehicles we were interested in. he was very knowledgeable and professional not to mention patient. he provided us with many options and waited while we test drove them all. once we zeroed in on ""the one"" the process went by rather quickly. travis in the finance department helped us button down that aspect and bryan s. in the service department really came through in getting our vehicle up to snuff in terms of some trim accessories that needed fixing. all in all we were very pleased and satisfied with our purchase and everyone involved in the process couldn't have been more awesome! thanks cbb!!!",5
"parlor has become one of my favorites to get pizza. while the dough may not be quite as amazing as at pizzeria bianco's it is a close second, and the fact that you do not have to wait 3-4 hours for a table more than makes up for this. 
whenever we go we make a point to order the funghi pizza, which never fails to be a favorite among all the people we introduce to the place either. i have also had several of their soups du jour and have never been disappointed. 
the ambiance is nice - i hear that much of the wood has been reclaimed from the beauty parlor days and that is just plain cool.",4
"i have eaten here dozens of times.
the fish is fresh.
the staff are nice.
the restaurant is intimate.
the location is out of the way - nothing else around.
i always order the tempura veg, spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll.  no complaints.",3
best pizza ever!  my new favorite pizza place!  the wings were good but the pizza was just  the best!,4
omg i love these beautiful souls! they always take the best care of my dog.  great service and very professional.,5
"fabulous!  it's been great watching from the grand opening until now. took my niece when she was little and then my children. have to remember some items are cash only.  we really enjoyed feeding the giraffes!

i haven't been since the rides have been added",5
"i came here for takeout and ordered the quinoa battered onion rings. a late night snack. 

it's deep fried so it doesn't qualify as healthy no matter how you cut it. :)

different than a conventional onion ring the fried quinoa has a dark super crunchy grainy texture. when you bite into the ring, it literally shatters to pieces. cool!

they give you about 8 large onion rings in a paper container. they are so good i wish i had more. interestingly they leave a clean oily not greasy after taste in your mouth.",4
"a true treat to dine at joel robuchon's! if only i could eat here every day. the cuisine is impeccable; the deserts are divine and as for and the wine, oh the wine, you must trust the servers wine pairing suggestions; they know what they are talking about. the set menu is the way to go. and sit at the bar so you can witness the magic that goes into your meals creation!",5
"absolutely the worst customer service. i have been a regular client for some time now. i called twice today and was placed on hold the first time for over 10 minutes and the second time for over 13 minutes. i finally hung up. i called back a third time, a while later and i was told to hold yet again. i asked what the delay was as i had already been on hold twice earlier in the day for an exorbitant amount of time? the response i received was  ""if you don't like to hold then you can hang up and call back some other time, we are busy right now and do not have time to answer these questions"", click....",1
"just ok, nothing bad nothing great. i wouldn't turn up my nose if i had to eat there again but wouldn't pick it as my choice as there are better asian places nearby.

detractors:

1. california roll was warm and had no cucumber. i'd never had a california roll without cucumber before.
2. teriyaki chicken was just a chicken breast heated on a hot grill. it was white and had not been charbroiled which is a must for teriyaki chicken in my opinion. it was dry and flavorless except for the sauce which wasn't too bad.
3. the rice was dry and not the normal japanese rice i'm used to.

positives:

1. iced tea was brewed and not instant like in many japanese places.
2. gyoza was good.
3. salad and soup that came with bento box were good.
4. surprised by fresh vegetables that came with the teriyaki chicken.",3
"writing this while i'm in the restaurant, so bear with me.

walked in and this place is making me feel right at home. its very small, not fancy, but has a little homey feel to it. seems like a place that should be in the city, not a strip mall in the burbs. there wasn't anyone to greet me so i had a seat where i wanted, and the place is basically empty so they didn't mind. chips came out, eh, nothing special and i'll probably liken the salsa to that of macayos. not bad, just nothing special. i ordered the sobrosomethingicantpronounce, and an empanada de puerco. i can never pass those up when i see them. 

the empanada was delicious, with a perfect crust. it was a bit sweet, and a bit tangy, the pork cooked in a green chili sauce really set it off. so far so good i am thinking, and i just heard the bell ring signaling my meal is ready...

so i just finished up my main course. delicious, the meat perfectly cooked and fell apart with a fork, and the vegtables over it almost tasted sweet as almost there was plantain in it. in whatever case, very well executed. i did not care for the white sauce over the potatos, and found it rather bland. the main dish was great overall. service was perfect from start to finish, though eight now i am the only one in here, so not sure what it would be like i'd they were busy.

+1 for great service +1 for making me feel at home +1 for a great meal",4
"unfriendly guys who didn't say hi back, and charged me $3 for each copy of my keys. ridiculously overpriced. don't come here.

update a few days later: copies no longer work and i got locked out of my house. this company is a complete fraud.",1
"i'm surprised by some of the bad reviews.  i've only been here twice, but both times were great.  here are my highlights.

service - i had courteous, quick service both times. 

food - i had coffee both times. once i had a donut and another time,  a cupcake.  the coffee is good.  i got a nitro cold brew last time and it was yummy.  the donuts are fabulous!  they are very fancy, more like french pastry than a typical donut. the cupcake was just ok.

atmosphere - the space is nothing special, but i think they did a good job with what they have.  

cost - no surprises here.  exactly what you would expect.  less than $5 for a cold press and donut.",4
i think this place is great. ingredients are fresh.. they did change the menu though.. i ordered chicken gyro bowl.. it's not good at all.  doesn't even look like chicken or gyro.. however the beef gyro or lamb gyro is really really good. love the sauce. please remove the chicken gyro from the menu...,4
"the food is excellent!,  i got the mixed kabob,  it comes with zaffron rice and roasted tomatoes,  the greek salad was very fresh. fried chicken & baklava was great too. don't expect anything fancy.",5
"4.5 stars, and worth the drive to the hood!  the billboards of the giant super 3-lb. burrito finally cast a spell on me, and i took the plunge.

la tolteca is not quite as full service as ranch market, but it's somewhat of a smaller version where you'll find a counter-service deli, panaderia, carniceria, jugeria, and a mini-market here.  even better is their cooking tools section (where you can buy huge tamale steamers, and mortar and pestles for making chile) and the catering menu which starts at $5 per person.  holy crap.  what a steal.  

upon entrance you'll see the deep pit outside where some man is grilling all the carne you'll find served inside.  as you step inside you'll see some brisk business - i found all sorts of types and ethnicities here - a young couple on a date, some girls gabbing over lunch and others ordering food and pastries to go.

the food here rocks.   it's very authentic, cooked by commadres and tias just like back home.   the grandma quotient on the beans and rice was very high -- always a standard assessment in my quest for good mexican food.  they have every imaginable burrito type here and they're huge and cheap - at $4.  i always opt for the veggie (rice, beans, cheese and guacamole) burrito and am always impressed - the best part being the freshly made tortillas.  i even bought some on my way out to take home.

the tacos are a good choice too.  the combo plates start at $5.  the carne asada (a little overcooked) was pretty good and delicious in a flavorful marinade, and the shrimp taco was really good - a much better choice i would add.  paired with some tamarind, strawberry agua fresca or horchata and you'll be in heaven.

i find the bakery to be the highlight regarding the food.  the pandulce was excellent - if a bit more fresh (than ranch market) given the way it's stored behind a glass case rather than self-service.  the conchas and pineapple empanadas were soft, sweet and delicious - with perfect texture.  everything from churros, to cakes, to flan, to sweet breads, to donuts and rolls.",4
"café rio has decent food but the menu just seems stale to me.   maybe i've eaten here too much over the years but i think they need to add something new.  it's not that i've had a bad meal, in fact just the opposite.  the food quality and consistency is very good between locations.  i've tried everything on their menu (and i mean everything) and it was all good but they needs something new and exciting to keep me coming back.   hell, i'll probably go back again anyways and eat the same stuff.",4
"guy was on time, worked two hours to fix problem & is coming back out for another solution soon. fair price, good workmanship. would use again!",5
"this place is definitely popular and packed - for a monday night it was a full house. for a large group, i would call to make reservations.

i can't seem to tell the difference between these ayce sushi places, and this one will probably get lost in the shuffle. i came here because my carpool driver wanted to take our family out and we decided on this place. seating is great if you get a booth, and there are plenty of them so one star for that! 

signature paper menus for you to check off which dishes you want and quantity. the orders are quite small sized which allows you to order a variety of dishes without feeling immediately full. small plates also ensures less food wastage which i am always for that. our table ordered signature ayce items such as rolls, hand rolls, ramens and udons, and yes, sushi\/sashimi. we ordered lots of the salmon sashimi so we definitely got our omega's.

i have to say service is efficient. plates are continuously brought and cleared at the same time. tea jugs are constantly full. 2 stars just for the seamless service in that regard. i noticed all the staff that served our table spoke mandarin which points to the clientele that come here. 

i wouldn't come out of my way here, and it wouldn't be my first choice for ayce, but if you happen to be in the area...

fyi - the parking area right outside this restaurant is chaos. parking lines are not meant to be followed which means you have to park in a way that your car crosses, almost to the middle, the yellow lines. the next trend i suppose...

also, if you're feeling ridiculously full, you can walk off the food at the supermarket close by. it sells house slippers for $1!!",2
"best learning center ever! my son loves it and literally goes running to the teachers! he says ""yay"" when we pull into the parking lot. they have really worked with my son on potty training and i love the arts and crafts the kids do. there are no tv's in the classrooms and i love that! i could go on and on. they make my son feel special and they make me so proud of him everyday by telling me what a great kid he is!

my family appreciates all of you at cactus.",5
"like the place; definite dive bar, but breakfast and service are very good. interesting atmosphere on sat\/sun mornings for porn in the morn....you really get desensitized to the porn after the third time or so that you attend one of those events. a lot of hardcore gambling machine players too if you're into that sort of thing.... the machines get a lot of mileage.

only thing i don't like about this place is the bathrooms...they don't necessarily smell awful but you can smell ""old, but cleanish bathroom"" scent in roughly a quarter of the bar. ventilation in those bathrooms needs to be redone.",3
"i went once and will never go back. incredibly rude girl. the worst sns gel manicure. she took the old gel nails off by prying the edge up and popping them off...thereby taking layers of my fingernails with them. first i asked her not to do that, she ignored me and kept doing it ...after asking again i got assertive, which made her mad. didn't shape my nails at all. put the sns layers on too thick and when i put my hands under the lights it instantly burned my nail beds and damaged my nail plate. the kind of damage that isn't salvageable. she was obviously clueless and couldn't care less about my nail.health. no offer of drink, and very rushed. my nails will be paying for this visit for 6 months.",1
"this place is staying 5 star in my books, i don't think that i could eat here and ever give it a poor rating. each time i've been i've had something different and loved it just as much as previous dishes. i was working in mississauga last thursday and got a last minute invite from resident expert david l to come meet him and his wife here for lunch.

here is the run down:

1) chicken briani rice (chicken rendang with briani) $8.50
- this was incredible, the rice was moist and the rendang was flavoured perfectly with a good bit of kick!

2) lontong (curry veg with rice)
$7.95
- compressed rice cake in spicy coconut & shrimp gravy with vegetables. loved this dish i'd recommend this as well. great flavour!

3) fried hokien mee
- this noodle dish was fab!

4) sago gula melaka $4.00 (dessert) 
- loved this as well, was the first asian dessert that i actually wish i could have had seconds and thirds.

like i said - i can't find enough good things to say about this place. if you are craving authentic singaporean food give this place a spin. locals know this to be legit and i gotta back them up on it now that yelp tells me i'm a regular :)",5
"read tempe r's review. i felt i created an alter ego like roger the alien from ameican dad because he literally had the exact same experience as i did. plus he said he's gone there twice without explanation so maybe we are in fact the same person that keeps changing personas. 

today it was 109 degrees and while i was waiting for my food...i did so outside because it was actually cooler than this muggy mess. how in the hell can they not have air conditioning...in phoenix, az...in the summer? the food is tough to grade because usually i rate it on a scale of good to bad. since the food had literally no taste, i have trouble attaching a grade to it. the sauces were the only thing i could taste, but they had a hint of bathtub water which didn't really surprise me at all. 

forunately for me i know the food was at least cooked fresh because i was the only one in their for the 30 minutes that my meal was being prepared. i am an aspiring restaurant owner so the sliver lining to this cloud is that one day, maybe i can be a little less terrible at operating a food joint than this place. i almost recommend that everyone try this place, if not for any other reason but the fact that you'll enjoy everything you ever eat again just a little bit more.",1
great customer service and the portobello fries are good. i did not like the vertical chicken that was served on a plate of black beans... yuck and why? idk. the mac and cheese was super generic. not worth the money here in my opinion but it's very fancy and the staff is great so that's cool.,3
"came for brunch on sunday morning. be prepared to wait a bit because there are only a few tables and they only let you order after you've secured one. the décor is pretty hip and the full menu is on the wall. ordered the chicken and waffles and a iced brew coffee. my girlfriend got the smoked salmon, portobello and kale eggs benny.

the drinks come out quick in cute mason jars. for the iced coffee you put the sugar and milk yourself. the food came shortly afterwards. the fried chicken was nice and crispy with a light well seasoned batter and it comes with a sweet and a little spicy sauce that goes well with the waffle.

i will definitely return some time to try their other menu items!",4
"got taken here by a vendor one evening. 

try their moscow mule and their gin and tonics. fantastic bartenders behind the bar. the mac and cheese and their flatbreads are great too! a bit pricey but definitely quality food that you are getting back in return!

awesome location and decor here. check them out!",4
"amazing!! we went here last night for dinner because i was craving butter chicken and some yummy naan. i told myself that i wouldn't get all-you-can-eat because it can get expensive. 

anyway - we walked in to an almost empty restaurant (except 3 tables). the place was pretty big and the server asked us if we wanted to do buffet or menu. i said menu to look at the prices (most main courses are about $12.99. then i moseyed around to the buffet to see what's on the table. i was blown away - usual items such as tandoori chicken, butter chicken, dal makhani, chickenpea curry, snacks like pakoras, etc. 

then, the unusual - lamb curry, goat curry!! i couldn't believe it and then we said we wanted to do the buffet instead. it was only $14.99pp. anyway - in the end, i can definitely say that it was totally worth it. everything was great. they brought out fresh naan for us and refilled water frequently. i ate so much and everything was great. i really like the paneer makhani too! the paneer (cottage cheese) was soft and yummy - so good. 

i highly recommend and it's a great place for a large party too. i'm surprised it doesn't have any reviews! (woo - first review!)",5
"i had lunch here and i have to say it was such a treat!!  joe the bartender was awesome and made me an amazing drink- pillowtalk mmmmmmm.  so good.  i didn't know what to get and kevin helped me choose.  best choice ever, thank you kevin!!  i had the stoner which was huge and delicious.  the service was super fast and friendly!  i was in between meetings and i still had time to chat.  i will be back asap.  this place would be perfect for my office holiday party.  yay!",5
"pretty disappointed with this place. i really wanted to like it, based on the reviews and also upon the initial phone call. my dog has been sick for some time now and has seen multiple vets and no one can find a diagnosis. the dr seemed 100% confident on seeing my pet that after some testing he'd be diagnosed. the prices are incredibly fair, and the staff is very friendly (although unprofessional looking) the techs that took my dog's blood were in street clothes, and the woman at the front desk seemed completely hairbrained. i was given a diagnosis of an infection and sent on my way with some antibiotics and instructions to call near the end of the round of medicine to inform the dr if he's feeling better or not. i called on thursday around 3pm to let the dr know that my dog is feeling even worse, and the receptionist told me she would inform the dr and call me back to see what he wanted to do next. it is monday night and i haven't heard a single word. i will say again, the prices here are incredibly fair, and they seem like nice people, but they're really unprofessional and disorganized, and my dogs care doesn't seem like a priority. i won't be returning.",1
had some cashew chicken with white rice. we ordered the tempura shrimp and a california roll. it was super yummy and they were so nice while picking up the order.,4
"trust no one. 
that's the mind set i have when it comes to repair men ..
but damn. i called home appliance repair after a quick yelp search, and a couple positive reviews. yelp didn't fail me!
 
my freezer\/fridge stopped being cold. i'm no technician, but i knew something was wrong. very very wrong. 
i know nothing about appliances so i was in complete panic mode when i called and someone picked up at 4pm, and this late in the day.  he told me he had a couple other appointments, but he'd be able to come by in 3-4 hours. without fail, he called, and was here within 4hrs.  same day! whoohoo! 

note:  i had called a whirlpool 'approved' tech and was told tuesday was the soonest they could send someone over. 
 
when mat arrived, he was quick and efficient at figuring out it was a simple fix, of my fan being stuck. he showed me the magnet on the fan that got caught, and quickly nudged it out,  then put the back of my freezer back together. 

while i had him here, and trusted him, i had him have a quick look at my dishwasher that i thought i had 'broken' about a year ago when the top shelf rotator thingee got jammed and i 'fixed' it by basically breaking it.
he quickly pulled out his little tool box, and found a metal screw that exactly fit the plastic piece that broken off, and tada! the top of my dish washer rack now has water rotation! 

i paid cash, $70, and 2  (first world) life altering fixes!  

note: $70 was cheaper than the service call quotes (which averaged at $90) i was getting earlier in the day from other companies.

even bigger bonus? 
matt, from home appliance services loved my dobermans! 
the guy is a dog lover.   :) 

i would recommend this guy without a doubt.
and he'll be my go-to when i replace my stackable laundry ... ugh!",5
"i really enjoy walnut grill!! i hardly ever do this, but i always get the same thing here...their brie & chicken quesadilla & chopped cob salad.

the quesadilla is one of my favorites. the grapes are my favorite part.

as a huge fan of chopped salads theirs is one of the best. it's all about the ratio, and they do it so well! the dressing is my favorite part. 

i will always pick wg over the chains that surround it!!!!",4
"after watching forrest gump and loving the movie, i had to try bubba gumps shrimping co. when i saw it on the strip i had to go there. this place is the bomb! their shrimp shack pasta is my favorite dish; it has tangy, buttery sauce over a bed of penne, tomatoes, and shrimp. the workers also play forrest gump trivia with you. it's quite amusing! if you get all the questions right, you get some sort of prize. when i went to the one in san francisco, they gave us free parking. 
i live in seattle, i wish i could take this place back home with me. it's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for!",5
"i love to eat chinese while i am in vegas and this place is no exception.  when you order the duck,.  makes sure to ask for the them to take the bones and make you a soup.  this soup is by far the best duck bone soup i have ever eaten (including in hong kong). the noodles here were delicious they were chewy and perfectly prepared.  everything on the menu is divine but pricey.  not a bad choice if you did well at the tables that day.  a well worth gastronomic splurge!",4
"the store wasn't busy. at all.

there were two salesmen and they both had bad attitudes. i had a simple question about a sim card and they copped an attitude with me. i was patient and when they were rude a second time, i began to cop and attitude. they finally did what i asked and i was on my way.

avoid this location.",1
"foie and french toast. 

you know, the way most friday nights get started. ok, not really, but if i lived in my own utopia this would be on the regular menu. 

black hoof is, as expected, all about the meats. and cheeses. and dranks. you could start or end your evening here and either way, it'll be a rich, indulgent experience. 

but back to the f&ft dish that our table shared... it was everything one might expect from a savory sweet meat treat. could i have eaten the whole thing by myself? but of course! dishes this rich are meant to be shared over moans and groans of delight. what else would one expect?

yes. very much yes.",5
came in with my 335i with flat tire.  billy was  very helpful and able to look up my vehicle history from previous owners number.  he was pushing me to get both rear tires replaced since it's a rwd.  i decided to get the free replacement instead. honest and informative guy!  will come here again if i get a flat tire!,5
"i'm giving this 4 stars for the service, but the crepe would have to be a 2 or 3..... i ordered the nutella crepe without whipped cream. in comparison to other crepes i've had before i felt like their crepes were made too thick and heavy on the egg side. i guess that's why it's called the waffle bar.... the service was fast and very friendly. the atmosphere in the restaurant is cool there's an up stairs as well with other shops.",4
"the rates were ok on dates before thanksgiving 2015. the whole place is old and dated, dark, somewhat dusty corridors leading to your room with no ref and old-style décor and bathroom fixtures. what i hated was that there was no wireless internet; you had to physically tie-in your laptop. i thought we were in the 21st century? alas, this place is still 1000 years behind, in the era of knights and dungy rooms. to be fair, the price was ok. will i go back? only if the room rates are reasonable, otherwise there are many other choices.",3
love this place but prices are kinda expensive compared to similar themed cafes,4
"yikes, my boyfriend and i decided to go here one day because it was a place we had never been too. it is also a place we will never go to again. one tip that the place was no good is the fact that we were the only people in the restaurant. this extremely peppy guy came in and started telling us what we could order and what was included, which i found very nice. we had some beef platter with veggies and a slice of strawberry and chocolate pie that was made somewhere else, because it was wrapped up like a delivered item. the beef was shaped like strings, not beef, so i'm not exactly sure what i  ate, but it wasn't the beef i know and love. the veggies were mediocre. the pie that wasn't made there was the best part.i'd go back for that, and only that.",1
"i remembered i loved the atmosphere here so i tried it again.  
i went with a group of three others. 
this time, the food was better than i had remembered.  
but there were two hiccups that come to mind.

the first hiccup was at the beginning of the evening when we arrived 15 mins before our reservation to be told that there would be a wait because a very large group came before us.  hey, i didn't really mind because as a matter of fact, we were early.  

however, we sat in the lounge\/bar and spent close to 40 dollars on four glasses of what was a very poor imitation of sangria.  having been to spain and having had the legit, elixir of the gods, that even non-drinkers have been known to fall in love with, i didn't expect as much.  but then again, i didn't expect hi-c fruit punch.  

20 mins after our reservation time, we were seated... 

but from then on, everything was pretty much smooth sailing.  

we ordered the sweetbreads & bone marrow, escargot, antipasto plate, and the mussels for appetizer courses.

antipasto plate was awesome, lots of different things to nibble on and share with others.  

mussels were good and the portions were big, considering this was a ""fancy"" restaurant where portions tend to be miniature servings.  i can't remember if it came with bread or if we used the bread from the antipasto plate or house bread that came, but we were all sloppin' up the juice from the mussels!

escargot... usually served either in a unique dish that holds the individual shells and you pop them out with a miniature fork; or cooked together with other ingredients but still in its shell.  at t. cook's, they do all the work for you, serving the snails out of its shell cooked with the other ingredients... it was good, but i didn't like that it took the ""special"" out of a typical escargot dish.  it's like going to eat crabs and all the meat was already picked out for you...  or sunflower seeds already out of its shell...

the sweetbreads and marrow dish really sucked the last time i came here but ordered it anyways because there really aren't many chances to order this type of ""offal"" dish in arizona.  this time, it really was good.  very well prepared and delish!  however, we were wondering what sweetbreads were called in spanish.  we got our young hispanic waiter who spoke spanish by the way and asked him.  i'm not fluent, but hearing ""pan"" and ""dulce"" were not what i was expecting... i was like ""uhmmm... excuse me, this isn't bread...""  he was ""it's not like a bread pieces glazed with a sweet sauce?""  i had to pull out my phone and look it up.  holy moly!  a waiter who doesn't even know what he's serving?  is that acceptable t. cooks???  
by the way, sweetbreads are molleja in spanish.

we also had 4 soups or salads, 4 entreés, and 4 desserts; nothing really outstanding or super memorable from what i remember.

along with a 50 dollar-ish bottle of wine, our bill was around 410 without tip.",3
"first time experience at a chiropractor.
dr dlugas was recommended by a friend and i am glad i listened.
a very painful left shoulder due to a surfing injury was relieved after 4 visits.
recently a long strenuous 35 mile hike had me hobbling along.
i did call and set up an appointment and as before after 2 treatments i am a lot better.
most insurance is accepted and i highly recommend her practice.",5
"bunch of hypocrites, they pride themselves in animal welfare yet i saw a job add they posted.  they were looking for a store manager, compensation was $13-15 an hour, that person can not even afford the product they are serving!  
furthermore, i tried to look into what they were feeding their animals, rowe farms is not certified organic (yet they charge organic prices), head office basically gave me the run around.  they ""try to avoid gmos"" in their animal feed.
at the end of the day there are so many fantastic new butcher shops opening up that pride themselves in transparency.  give these guys a pass, the company has gone to the dogs since someone from loblaws became the ceo.  glorified middleman that you pay a premium for, that is all rowe farms is now.",1
"this review is for the buffet.

the buffet at ceasars palace is the reason i was reluctant to try buffets when i first traveled to vegas. the buffet here is the epitome of why i fear buffet style served food. 

i went to this place for dinner and it was the worst buffet i've been to in vegas so far. it was very small. not a lot of selection. and everything was terrible. we're talking cafeteria lunch terrible. i kept trying things in the hopes i would find something that was at least decent. alas, everything was bad. how do you mess up pasta and tomato sauce? how do you mess up cookies and chocolate cake? ugh. 

given the fact that new buffets are springing up all the time in vegas, i definitely will never come back here.",1
i enjoyed this show and it was impressive.  i would recommend it to anyone i know.  i was amazed by the flying around.... just amazing to watch.  the theatre is pretty big and the stage is big.,5
"being a single mother of three, my house is usually a disaster. i've been getting house cleaning service for the past couple of months from check maid.

"i moved to las vegas 8 months ago, and was in desperate need of a haircut! i saw the reviews for ny hair co. and decided to give it a chance. boy, am i glad i did! the stylists are all super friendly, warm, and welcoming. i always leave the chair with an haute cut. i went to ny hair co. for my wedding (lasted all day and night), and go regularly for trims and new styles. the stylists are all up to date with the latest trends in hair and do a fantastic job of really listening to their clients and what they want. i definitely recommend this place whether you're just in town for the weekend or live in the area!",5
"i ordered a valentine's day arrangement through this shop for my fiancé, and he loved it.  he received it in the morning at his store and was surprised with the gift.  the only mistake was that his name was misspelled.  fruit was fresh.  the person who delivered it was both professional and friendly.",4

"séjour familial à 5 au mirage. bien que nous ayons pris soin de demander via notre agence de voyage d'avoir deux chambres communicantes, la consigne n'avait visiblement pas été transmise. après quelques minutes de discussion, l'hôtesse d'accueil a fini par nous trouver deux chambres mitoyennes, communicantes. quelques minutes de plus ont permis de négocier les $40 de supplément que ce genre de chambre prévoit théoriquement.
a part ce menu désagrément, les chambres sont spacieuses et propres, et l'hotel est très agréable. tout est en supplément bien sûr, mais comme partout à vegas.
la piscine est grande et joliment paysagée. les enfants l'ont adorée. il y a suffisamment de transats pour que chacun puisse faire une petite sieste au soleil.
nous ne sommes pas allé voir les tigres blancs, ni les dauphins (cher et beaucoup de monde).
le spectacle du volcan commence le soir à 7:00 pm, mais allez-y plutôt quand la nuit est bien noire. les effets sont plus impressionnants.",4

"best pizza in arizona hands down. this not only takes me back east, but it takes me to italy! if you want authentic, made with tlc pizza this is the place to come. the atmosphere is that of a little cafe in italy, but with an incredible view of the brick oven and the pizzas being made. whether you're sitting outside admiring the lovely surroundings , or sitting inside enjoying the adorable rustic decor, you are sure to be pleased, and served promptly no matter how busy! i absolutely love the margarita pizza, but they're all delectable. i would definitely ask your sever for their recommendations as well, as some of the best ones i tried i would never think to order myself.",5
"the original smashburger is super tasty but also very sloppy. maybe i put on too much ketchup and mustard. it's a great deal. and close to az on the rocks gym. they serve beer, which sets this chain apart from others.",5
"i had so much good time in this place those last couple years and today i had a bad experience!  service was cheap and our waitress didn't know the list of beers, she had to come back two times at the table because we ordered something she said they have it and few minutes later she came back to say that they don't have it. the menu that she gave us were dirty and sticky.",2

"meh mcd. i'm a big mcd fan but i'm not very impressed with this mcd. i've been there many times n i think what makes a mcd standout is their service and cleanliness because all mcd serve the same food! i went there many times already. their ketchup \/ fountain station is always messy, one time i wanted to get me some ketchup and once i pumped it out. .multiple fruit flies just zoooom went everywhere.......   it was so gross that i can clearly remember it. 

food is okay its average. nothing bad. one day i wanted to grab a coffee and work on my laptop elegantly at mcd ... i realized their wifi never works. :\/ yikes.",3
"classic bait and switch. the front office staff here are horrendous. please pass this place up. i went in for a $20 exam and x-ray full expecting to need work done. i received a quote for $2200 that included a fair amount of work. that was if i paid cash, if i used insurance it would be less i was told (not told how much less). i consulted and purchased a dental plan though my insurance company and read up what they would cover and contacted the billing dept at bright now!. i was told by the staff there, to get all the work done in my quote it would be roughly $900. i paid that and they started work which started with a debridment that included a deep cleaning after the other work was complete. next came fillings before i had extractions the following week. i found out the night before my extractions i would have to pay an additional $600 for extractions. so i scraped that together and asked if my deep cleaning was still covered under what i had paid and was told it was. after the extractions i was told in order to get the deep cleaning it would be an additional $360, and another $380 for whitening. this was all supposed to be covered under my insurance and $900 co pay, after doing the math i realized my co pay came out to $2240, almost to the dollar what they said i would pay without insurance. i confronted them about this and they denied everything, created a new billing\/estimate (right in front of me) and said everything they said was accurate. they are con artists and liars. i like the actual dental staff and wonder if the have any idea what is going on up front? all i know is the office staff are piss poor excuses for human beings. these people will bait and switch you, lie cheat and steal. stay away!!! learn from my lesson.",1
"a nice fast-casual burger experience. usually very busy but lines just move quickly especially with the foot traffic in vegas. burgers were good, a tad overrated though. will return, it was tasty nonetheless.",4
"i'm very disappointed, my client had  an ant and a rat problem. the ants kept on coming back, as for the rat problem they used glue traps for a mouse size not a rat size. the first tech was horrible he just sprayed and did not even check behind the oven and under the sink for setting rat traps the only used medium size mouse glue traps!!! for rat problems you use rat traps!!! very disappointed!!! they would rather blame the customer that hired them and not evaluating the rat problem !!!!",1
"we had to come see this place because we watch the show.  their was a line when we arrived, but it moved quickly.  if you are fans of the show it is worth the time to see the shop,  we took the deuce from our hotel.  now we can check it off our list of things we want to do when we are in vegas, and yes, we bought the tee-shirt.....",3
"tried them at the las vegas food fest this past weekend. very good ice which is hard to find in las vegas. 
i like the flavor selection as well, both the cherry and black cherry were great. i enjoyed the cherry pieces in the cherry ice. 
have not yet tried the ice cream but that will be next on the list, too bad they are way across town.",4

"jan rouven was amazing!

i got 5 comped tickets through my company to see this show and to be honest was not expecting much from a show at the clarion. boy was i wrong!

us ladies were running behind schedule getting ready and dolled up for the night so we ended up walking in as the show was about to start.

we were seated in a booth in the back of the showroom and asked if we would be able to sit closer as we saw many open booths in the front open. no problem the usher moved us to a booth up front and center stage! we were so close we could smell the sweat of the performer's bodies!

jan rouven is not only nice to look at and adorable with his german accent, he can really put on a show!

the magic\/illusion stunts he does are really good, we were extremely entertained with all of his acts.

he provides for some audience participation which is fun!

his dancer's both female and male are awesome as well!

criss angel should come see this show and take note on what a real illusions show should be! jan rouven puts criss angel to shame and does not have a nasty cocky attitude that criss does.

after the show jan came out and signed autographs, and took pictures with everyone! he is so sweet and down to earth!

this show is children friendly as well.

the music had me bumping in our booth!

4 strong stars well deserved!",4
"on the first day of my vegas vacation i realized somewhere during our travels to vegas my camera had broke. ugh. my mind was preoccupied by the thought of a vacation with no camera. i lamented the whole morning about my options, ruling out disposables because no self respecting photog would stoop that low. i even called all of the local camera repair shops with no luck for a place to get my broken baby repaired. i started to get frustrated as we walked to the forum shops at caesar's palace. i finally had a mini-meltdown where i burst into tears by the fountain at the shops. after wiping away my tears i looked up to see a beacon of light - no wait, it was just the sony style shop where i bit the bullet and bought a brand new cybershot for $180 (totally compatible with the fully charged battery and 4gb memory card from my broken camera). the day was saved! i immediately started taking pictures and felt a million times happier.

long story short, thank god for this store. the staff was totally helpful (and sympathetic) and the price was right.",5
"i'm another fan!!  when my ac wasn't working, i assumed the worst and called flores to give me a quote.  they kept me informed throughout the day and did everything they could to fit me into their schedule.  it turned out to be a minor electrical problem after all.  miguel and his guys showed up just as the electrician had finished his work and the unit was running.  even though i wasn't able to use his services, when the time comes, i will definitely give him a call.  i am so glad that i have found one of the good guys!!  other vendors have recommended him too, which speaks volumes.",5
"nice addition to the neighborhood. cute little eatery with completely yummy bbq. they have a number of meats and sauces to choose from. the ribs were fantastic, meat just falls off the bone. nice outdoor area for the thankfully cooler nights we now have. plus the patio is dog friendly!! there is nice bar area inside. if looking for some good bbq, go check it out!",4

"i frequent this place every time i'm in oakville and never regret it. i recommend going on a weekday afternoon and doing all you can eat here. that is definitely when you will get the most value for your money.

my favourite things to order include: the deep fried maki rolls, the dragon maki rolls, the green curry chicken, and the udon. all are fantastic and have a really unique flavour to them. the service is also always friendly and quick. your food will never take too long to arrive and it will always be hot and well made. lastly, this place is also really good for accommodating large groups; my boyfriend and i often come here when his large group of friends (6-8 people) are having a get together.",5
"outstanding.  what a delicious surprise. when my son suggested we go there i was reluctant because i was not really in the mood to try anything new and normally not a 'burger person'.  we started w\/ the specialty appetizer, oxtail chili cheese fries-- great balance of flavors and there was a perfect ratio of toppings to fries, which were crispy and cooked perfectly. 
the burgers are sublime. unique, and full of flavor on the perfect bun. we literally just got back and had to write this because we were so inspired and happy to have such a satisfying and delicious meal.  can't wait to return to bachi burger to try something else.  the ambiance of the restaurant was very nice, casual but modern and elegant.  our server was knowledgable, friendly, and attentive.  prices are extremely reasonable.  looking forward to our next visit!",5
"we were in the mood for some delicious chinese and ordered delivery from china a go go. orange chicken, bbq pork, egg rolls, crab rangoons. everything was on point, exactly what we were craving! and delivery estimated 45 minutes and they arrived at our door within 10 minutes!! it was incredible. great portion sizes, too.",5
this was my first time staying at the clarendon hotel and it was absolutely amazing!!!! service from the time you walk to the front lobby until checkout is phenomenal.  you receive a complementary full breakfast that is out of this world! everything is fresh and delicious.  it is so hot here in phoenix and you could not ask for a more accommodating and beautiful pool\/spa! i would recommend the clarendon hotel to all my friends and family! thanks for the amazing experience bill and justin!!!,5
"der club tryst befindet sich im wynn hotel am südlichen las vegas boulevard. die musik ist sehr laut. am
besten hat uns der große wasserfall am eingang gefallen. die ausstattung ist
luxuriös, allerdings schon etwas abgenutzt. die preise sind nach meinem
ermessen völlig überteuert und in kleinster weise angemessen. ein tisch mit
bottle-service für 4 personen hat über 600 dollar gekostet. das hat wirklich keinen

"i really like this place. it's fun and has a lot to do while just hanging out with your friends. i don't care for the food. i've only ever eaten outside and everything was always ok. nothing great and nothing i'd want to take home and eat later (but i did take leftovers because they're pricey). drinks are good they have a nice variety. it's family friendly because they have bean bag toss, jenga, ping pong, chess and checkers. overall fun place near downtown glendale.",4
"stopped in at havana grill for lunch this past weekend. it made high marks for simple and flavorful food, friendly service and a pleasant atmosphere. we started with the papas rellenas, which were surprisingly flavorful, even with the heavy potato on the outside. 

i ordered the pollo a la plancha as my entrée, which was basic but delicious. the onions were cooked just enough to take out the bite but still remain a little crisp, the chicken was moist, and the black beans and rice were the perfect compliment. 

i definitely plan on going back soon. especially since happy hour is 4-9 pm every day!",4
"scott was great!  he came to my house on time and took all my dull knives and scissors out to his truck and 15 minutes later he brought them back in sharp!  he was friendly, professional and even showed me what to do to keep them sharp as time goes on.    the cost was unbelievable, i was expecting it to be high because he drove to my house, i was pleasantly surprised.   i would highly recommend sharp n it to friends and family that need anything sharpened.  thank you scott!",5

absolutely yummy food and their pakoras rock! was a truly delicious experience and look forward to a future visit :).,5
"chauncey is the absolute best. i just moved to pittsburgh and was nervous about getting a haircut, since i've been seeing the same stylist for my entire life (if you're ever in hockessin, delaware, seiko at beauty bar by seiko does amazing work). but i decided to just go for it since my hair was super foul looking.

this is literally the best haircut i have ever had. chauncey was so sweet and friendly, and she also really went out of her way to show me how to recreate the look when i'm doing my own hair. she also somehow customized the photo i showed her to be proportionate to my face shape and hair type. 

the salon is funky and has a great atmosphere. oh, and you can buy cute vintage clothes while you're waiting (or after you're done). the prices are also really, really reasonable (i have never seen better than $50 for a woman's haircut by an experienced stylist). the staff was professional and friendly and made me feel comfortable. i'm so glad to have found this salon!",5
i have taken the opportunity to give this place several more tries and have really come to enjoy the staff and especially the food. i guess they had a bad night but clearly their norm is great food and service,5
coming from the great state of texas l know brisket. saucemans brisket can compete with texas brisket! saucemans food is delicious side's are great and the owners are awesome thanks for the food and great time. david c. from texas,5
i would say that the food here was average. the waiter took about half an hour to get our drinks. the best dish i had at this place was the bread pudding.,3
"the hotel check in went smoothly and then my room was a bit of a walk from check in so i ended up tipping a bellman to do it. the rooms themselves are nice but not super super nice. bed was comfy. super close to amazing food in old town which is nice. ordered room service this am and both meals we got , the bagel and lox and turkey benedict with tomato based hollandaise are very good but they didn't bring any salt and pepper and i know that's minor but black pepper on both meals would have been nice. i ordered juice from the juice bar which was also very good but they  didn't add the ginger like i had asked. all in all  for the price of the hotel it is def with the stay. the bathroom door did fall off the hinge this am and i am to small to fix it so that is a bit of an issue as i need to get in there at some point :)  beautiful grounds and friendly staff . just little details are missing to make it a four star stay. 3.5",3
small decent showroom. some cool cars but not worth the drive. they were filming the first time we tried to go and had to come back a little later. would skip this if you aren't a hardcore count fan.,3
"so excited i found this place.  little shop in arcadia area, sized my new watch band for me while i waited, owned\/operated by a very nice gentleman.  so fast! extremely reasonable, but be sure and bring cash with you.  highly recommend them.",5
"the laundry room is a hidden gem on fremont street.  text the number listed and hope you can get a reservation. what was so nice was going off menu and giving the mixologist flavors you wanted out of your drink. spicy, smokey, bitter, etc. he was able to craft unbelievable drinks out of the flavors you wanted.  if you can get a seat it is a must do, can't wait to go back.",5
"i trust, respect and believe in these guys. they've always been fair, honest and they don't 'sugar-coat' your car problems. they also do all they can to make it as budget-conscience as it can be. 

i will always recommend this shop for any and all repairs or maintenance.",5
good show by cirque du soleil at bellagio las vegas. so nice and if you have seat at the first floor that really good coz you gonna see everything and everywhere,5
"clearly no longer a secret...but for you first timers. it's up the stairs. 
pizza isn't anything to write home about but definitely hits the spot. the place is out if the way and gives you a break from everything else vegas has to offer. 
oh and did i mention the place is cheap! $10 gets you a slice and a beer and leaves a decent tip in the jar.",4
"have eaten and drank here many times, and there are a few good things on the menu. get the regular burger, skip the graze burger. korean influenced choices are solid. drinks are always solid. bartenders are awesome, servers a little less attentive than desired, but they're very busy.",3
"this is where i want to go after i die. specifically, i'd like to be wedged between the omelet bar and the pesto mashed potato station. if you've done the previous night up right, you will not want to pop for the champagne brunch and instead should just pay the $26 for the alcohol-free buffet. a fellow in my group went for it and ended up drinking about a sip and eating half a plate of watermelon. which means he missed out on one of the better experiences of my life. i hit that bitch a record four times. my inner fat kid cried with joy whilst stuffing her face with pesto mash. seriously. try it. you'll never go back.",5
"my favorite food!  love the fresh, nutritious options!  delish!",5
"great cocktails and a delicious twist on ""bar food"" here! 

i've wanted to make it down to this quaint establishment in the strip for some time, but had just not found the right time until last night - glad i did! when we arrived, our waiter explained that the mixologists generally prefer that the patrons inform them of their desired base spirit, and that they will then make a hand-crafted mixed drink based on that preference, rather than the usual card menu of standard cocktails. they are big into using the freshest ingredients here, including house-made juices, mixers, and even have their own tonic for their g&t's.

ambience was good - although the attractive patterned ceiling did little to mute out the loudness of the music and conversations. the wait staff were friendly and efficient, offering nice suggestions for each person in our party after hearing our preferences. we had the fried smelts (yum!!), patatas bravas (yum!), bacon wrapped dates, and charcuterie plate to pick on while we enjoyed our beverages. all were tasty and well-presented.

overall, i agree with the people who have told me about how much they enjoy bar marco, and will definitely be back for more!",4
this location is always busy inside and the drive-thru always has a few cars waiting.  the tables are always taken with wi-fi users.  the employees are cheerful and it's conveniently located.,4
"this place is always busy...food comes out pretty quick.  we usually end up there at least once a week.  everything we tried has been great!  my favorite is the fried tofu and saigon pho.  for lunch, make sure you get there early...or late if you want a table.  otherwise, you might end up at the big table with other people.",5
"i had been craving some chinese food at a cheap price we payed $32.00 for the wifey, son(3 year old)  and myself. i went for the sushi they place their sushi trays in like a wood cutting board on top of ice so the sushi doesn't really stay cold. eh, i ate like 2 pieces and left the rest in the plate. next to the sushi was was this umami kimchi! loved it! any ways i continued my dinner went for other food and well it was ok but now im sitting here in my toilet with a stomach ache!! sorry that escalated pretty quick. won't be returning. on to the next.",2
"food is awesome, service is crap.  couldn't care less, i still love this place.  get the tacos al pastor and the texas rita. also the scream cheese is banging.",4
"been here twice. i am ok w the vegetarian (not vegan) offerings. the price point is totally fine. the location...it's stonecrest. it's going to be crowded on the weekend especially since smashburger is right by the fun outdoor seating area. the restaurant can get very noisy when almost at capacity. table turnaround time isn't bad. the last time i went when we opened the door we were the end of the line. in 13 minutes we were placing our order with a calm, cool, and collected cashier and by the time we filled our drink cups a table had opened up. on both trips here the food was delivered within 10 minutes. overall not bad.

here's why i do not plan on going back: my little dude ordered a (different) burger each time and 20 minutes after we left the place his stomach went crazy wonky*. 

*this is my vague way of saying he blew up the bathroom.",3
"great place.  the staff made us feel welcome, and the food was delicious, with generous portions. i love the soup that comes with dinner, and the margaritas did not disappoint. there may be too many choices for what you want, but that is not a bad thing.  i was so happy to find this place for my visit to vegas.  so nice we went twice, in one week.",5
"was für eine enttäuschung! die preise gehoben, die qualität dürftig, das passt so nicht! der maki war sehnig und nicht frisch, der lachs ebenfalls, die miso-suppe eine tütensuppe (kein scherz!), unflexibel in der bestellung, leider sehr unbefriedigend! welten zwischen i love sushi und fai sushi, aber eine solche enttäuschung habe ich schon lange nicht erlebt! teuer, miese qualität, ich werde nie wieder hingehen!",1
"notes: reservations are highly recommended; must get the dekitate tofu, sake cheese fondue and kitsune udon.

the space barely has more than 50 seats. we reserved a table at 5pm because we had plans in the evening and were laughing at how silly that seemed....who even eats dinner this early? but upon arrival we noticed that every. single. table. was reserved and suddenly we were very glad that we had decided to book. while we were eating, we noticed many groups being turned away because reservations took up the restaurant - even bar seats were reserved! 

as their logo is a chicken (while kinton's is a pig for pork!), their main skewers consisted of chicken parts. now, i say chicken parts because there is really no limit to what they skewer from the chicken. rare finds include: chicken tail, chicken oyster (ie. chicken testicles), chicken gizzard and chicken neck. most chicken and pork skewers range from $1.30 - $2 but the beef skewers range all the way up to $9 for a wagyu beef skewer

yakitori kintori grills their skewers using binchotan technique which is a traditional japanese charcoal that burns at a very low temperature for a longer period. this results in less smoke from the charcoal which is perfect (and much more preferred) for indoor restaurants.

on to our favourite dishes of the night:

- kitsune udon ($7 for 3) deep fried tofu & udon noodle in dashi broth
this was one of the most unique dishes of the night! we were really confused when the dish came because we ordered this expected a bowl of soup udon. imagine our surprise when we realized the udon is actually wrapped in the deep fried tofu and served in a delicious dashi broth. adored the presentation of it all and it was really odd biting into a tofu and getting a mouthful of noodles instead. 

- chicken kaarage ($6) skewered deep fried chicken
 guu's karaage never fails to impress and this karaage fell nothing short of our expectations of guu's.

- dekitate tofu ($7) tofu prepared at your table
this is a must order. we were really excited to try this dish because the tofu is prepared fresh tableside. not only is the dish fun because they prepare it table side but holy cow, this tofu is the softest tofu i have ever eaten. it is served with a white salt and a smoked salt, which was absolutely heaven. give the tofu 10 minutes to cook, then scoop it into your bowls. a really nice break from meat and fish.

- nonkotsu kaarage ($5.5) deep fried knee cartilage
this is another of our family favourites - we love chicken knee cartilage. while this was really good, we were missing the distinct crunch from the cartilage. but we would order this again in a second.. in fact, we were going to if we weren't so full!

- houji cha creme brulee ($5) green tea creme brulee
a definite recommend! the tea-flavoured is unreal and does not taste like the artificial tea you typically taste in supermarket green tea ice cream . it really, really tastes like a cup of tea. very enjoyable and ended our meal on a very sweet note.

- beer sorbet ($5) sapporo beer sorbet
for beer fanatics, this is your saviour. it is a very strong taste of beer with the same bitterness. very refreshing and enjoyable but it is not for everyone. if you're not the type of person to drink beer, you probably won't enjoy this.

there were some hits and misses but we will definitely be stopping by yakitori kintori again. service is on point but it is more of an eat and go restaurant rather than a long lengthy dinner like jabistro. this is not the place for a bunch of hungry men. like guu, while each plate is cheap on its own, it is very easy to rack up the bill. i actually overheard a party of 2 saying they were eating at yk for a light snack before heading to kinton ramen downstairs for their ramen!",4
great decor and patio out front.  overall the food was very good.  it is a limited menu but everything was cooked well.  we had great service and the food was presented very well. we went with the brussels as a side and they were great with a good lemon finish.  i had the pork sandwich and it was full of flavor and the pickled onions were perfect.,4
"yeah, it's a nice addition to the shit hole we all know as lincoln disastrafuck, but for a co-op it's not anything special.  

i guess it's super expensive, pretentious and awkwardly located, like any other co-op, but their eco-friendly toilet paper selection is like totally limited and what's with all the computers at the checkout and the open refrigerator cases?!  looks like someone around here doesn't care about poisonous metals, child labor or living the green lifestyle!

you can hardly trust these kind of people who pick and choose the parts of the lifestyle they like and forget the parts they don't.  it's all in or all out, judas, okay!!!!  

by the way, what dimwit pencil-dick magic-the-gathering-playing fuck came up with the name common ground?  did ya look down the hallway, asshole?  some other tribe of marketing-for-dummies-reading diarrhea-variety-shit-for-brains idiots already jumped on that loser train.",1

"after all the hype from friends about how great this place was, my saturday dinner buffet, as far as the food was concerned, they were a total disappointment. 

i tried a little bit of everything, they all come in small dishes anyways, but all the food were either too salty or too sweet. i am not talking about typical american restaurant food saltines level, the dishes were like double to sometime triple those saltiness. yes, i drank a couple glasses of water plus another big glass of lemonade. 

when the food were not salty, they were mostly on the sweet side. i had to take a second look at my various salads to make sure they weren't dessert items. 

as far as selection goes, very little seafood, primarily your typical snow crab legs; lots of chicken variations; very chewy prime rib; very limited sushi selection; and overly sweet desserts. 

will i go back, definitely not. will i go back if it's free? not if they are still serving the same food.",2
"if there's an option for negative stars, caribou would get it! they are awful! my condo association brought them on as property management. at first they were pretty good in getting things done, and admittedly the property did have a lot of things that needed taking care of. as time passed, the property got passed from one manager to the next. things got bad quick! they came up with a special assessment payment schedule for all the owners to pay an additional $5000+ for the year in hoa fees to make major repairs on the property, and that was the cost to cover everything. well the following year, guess what? only part of what needed repairing got completed and everyone now has to pay an additional $3000+ this\/next year in special assessment fees! they charged my hoa $40\/hour for cleaning of the grounds and common areas in the building, when they only pay their cleaning crew $13.80\/hour! talk about some sketchy crap! they also double dip in their charges for repairs, i.e. they will bill the hoa for certain types of work done on top of charging each individual owner if work is done for a single unit! is that even legal?
about a few months before we switched management companies, suddenly all of the recycling dumpsters on the property disappeared. i asked one of the property caretakers, and she gave me some sketchy answer about how the waste management company goes through all the trash once everything is back at the facility and sort out trash from recycling, so it's more cost effective to eliminate recycling bins when they do all the work anyway back at the facility. um...what? anyone else smell some b.s.?
what sent me over the edge about caribou was over the summer, there were some scheduled repairs to fix the dryer vents in each unit and it was going to be about a 3 week project, which required maintenance to enter each unit multiple times throughout the 3 weeks, 5 days a week, from 8am-4:30pm. i am a freelancer, so my work hours are sporadic, so i emailed the property manager to ask for more specific times my unit will need to be available, and if there was something they could do to accommodate my work schedule. not only was he not willing to lift a finger to help, he talked to me as if i'm a tenant of his, and he was my landlord. he refused to let me talk to his maintenance staff to work something out, as he said that he had no control over timing since he was the one doing the repairs. and then in his response email he wrote, ""your dad has been working with us with the repairs of the previous two buildings, so you can ask him how the process works"" (my dad was on the board of directors for the hoa). again, what? what is this? 1954? i have to go ask my dad? furthermore, he is getting paid by my hoa to answer my questions, not pass me off to my dad! it's not like he's paying my dad a cut of what he's getting from my hoa. i had smoke coming out of my ears, and chose to call him instead of emailing back and forth. the conversation was unproductive, and ended in my hanging up on him. during the actual repairs, i talked to the maintenance staff and they were more than happy to accommodate my schedule, no problems at all. nothing like what the guy was trying to make it out to be.
my association has since parted ways with caribou, thankfully. though we now have to hire accounting investigators to figure out why the funds for the repairs were used up so quickly and so off from the original estimate. sketchy!!!
stay away from these guys!!!! negative infinity stars!",1
"i recently purchased a 2017 lincoln mkx from sanderson lincoln. i had the pleasure of working with steve jaronik, a true professional and never did i feel any pressure to close the deal. he let me spend my time and he was prepared to work up numbers on several vehicles. i finally settled on ingot silver with ebony interior, and couldn't be more pleased. the attention to detail by everyone there was outstanding and their concern that i was getting the car i wanted made me feel confident that sanderson was the right choice. next week the tech specialist will be at the house to link up some things which is a very nice feature. 
so, if you're in the market for an awesome lincoln, i recommend the mkx, and sanderson, and you definitely should meet and work with steve jaronik.

called your ballys restaurant this week to make a reservation with a specific waiter my husband and i had on our first date. it's our anniversary. got there tonight only to be told waiter isn't working tonight. hostess was very rude and disrespectful. way to ruin a special night. won't ever be back,1

"great  fish tacos, very fast service,   loved the homemade chips and salsa.   i had  2 fish and 1 shrimp taco  they were very flavorful  .and very nice decor, great sugar skull art work on the walls.  parking was good too,  nice big parking lot just north of it and very short walk.  i will  be back soon.",4
"this greasy spoon hits the spot.  although a bit intimidating from the street due to some of the sketchy people hovering around, its staff is super nice and even the cook says hello. the food was good,  particularly the pancakes. bring your own real maple syrup as the fake stuff they serve does not belong on those delicious pancakes.",3
"i decided to give them a go and guess what- i am soooo glad i did otherwise i would have never known what kind of place this is!

ok so let me start with saying that its a really cute cozy pizza shop where you actually get the sense of hometown atmosphere! 

pizza is delicious!!! i mean it! for collage students and people who like to have big parties and not be embarrassed i would say pizza decasa! love the pizza crust and sause is also  smth different!

i dont exactly know what they have but they have smth addictive about their food, i ordered from here once and now i am a regular! try and give it a chance and they are there to impress you!

and by the way food came piping hot and the driver was extra nice as well!",5
"dressed with history, beauty, glamour and ambience, princes street gives the unsuspecting passerby a glimpse of edinburgh's historic splendour as well as its buzzing high street shops and cafes. the southern to mid-section of the street is enriched with the commanding walter scott monument, the peaceful sanctity of the princes street gardens, the grecian-style national gallery and the bank of scotland headquarters towering in the distance, all set against the emotional sounds of the lone piper that usually plays throughout the day.


 boutique stores and major mainstream outlets equipped with the latest trends and fashion in clothes, music and home décor, will easily charm you into perusing. a vast collection of statues commemorating scotland's heroes are situated throughout the length of the street, providing a window into times gone by.


 visiting princes street wouldn't be the same if you didn't take time to browse in jenner's, the world class department store often referred to as edinburgh's harrods. housed in a victorian building, this multi-storey store offers class and style with elegant chandeliers and dark wooden banisters. if you are feeling hungry, the café in jenner's does a mouth watering and very reasonably priced full scottish breakfast.",4
"i wish i could love this place. i should, since they have so many vegetarian options for me. i mean i really appreciate them for that, i really do! but the food, it's just not that great. i've had a lot of things on their menu including their spinach pies with all sorts of add ons, french onion soup, sandwiches, veggie burger... the only thing that i really liked was the bbq seitan burger. everything else was kinda meh. i come back once in a while but it's not a place that i really get too excited about. oh well.",3
"josh is the store manager at this store and he run's it like a boss! super friendly guy and makes the best espresso drinks i have ever enjoyed. super consistent in taste, quality & service!",5
some of the best and most flavorful steaks that i've ever had. we had 2 huge ribeyes from different ranches and some a5 kobe. the ribeyes were both excellent and had very unique differences in taste. i'm glad that the waiter recommended that we try the different ribeyes. the kobe was cooked tableside on hot stones. absolutely perfect! the desserts didn't disappoint either. the service was very good and the waiter was extremely helpful. i have recommended this place to multiple friends and family and there is no doubt that i'll be back when i'm in town.,5
best burger in town oddly enough. the pizza is also very good with a build your own option. wood fired pizza is the only way to go.,5
i love love love the steam room. i got the steam pass which gives you one month unlimited usage of the steam room and lounge. turkish steam rooms are my favourite and this one is a beauty. the smell of hamman spa is so relaxing. im not sure what the other services are like but the steam room is amazing.,4
"we did not hire this company, but our neighbours did to remove a tree on their property. the tree in question hung over onto our property by a few meters. the viking tree removal employees trespassed onto our property and began moving our belongings without permission or notifying us. they also threw most of the tree debris onto our property and neglected to clean most of it up. they dropped large parts of the tree trunk onto our lawn and patio, destroying multiple patio stones, and creating large depressions, and holes in our lawn. when we confronted them about this the viking employees responded incredibly rudely and made no effort to compensate us. an absolutely abysmal company with horrendous employees, do not hire them, hire real professionals who know what they are doing.",1
"very disappointing experience. after i left, a small pair of needle-nose pliers were missing. it's a small item to most people but a big deal for me as i keep them in my car for hiking with my dog to get cactus spines out of his paws. i called and spoke to the manager and all he kept saying was that he did the vacuuming and he didn't see them. he didn't even bother to take the time to ask all the other people that worked on my car. when i told him i would have a hard time coming back because i felt someone was being dishonest, all he said was ""ok"".  i could not believe the poor customer service that i received here, and the lack of any attempt to make things better!  i will not be going back.",1
"absolutely delicious food, treats, cake, and service. my favorite is the french toast with potato hash, but everything has been amazing. my son's first experience of eating biscuits & gravy and it is his first request if we are going to go to breakfast. i've taken my family for lunch and they have a great variety of options. i haven't had anything i didn't like from there. 

they did my daughter's cake, for her 12th birthday. it was batman themed and my daughter designed it. they were super thrilled with her ideas and more than happy to accommodate. 

so thrilled they are in my neighborhood. love the inviting environment. great locals place.",5
"hubby and i and some friends came here for an early dinner on a saturday night and were able to be seated right away. i liked the japanese themed wall art, particularly the sumo wrestler artwork. 

we enjoyed everything we ordered, including unagi risotto, marinated short ribs, marinated black cod, and takoyaki. the takoyaki in particular was probably some of the best i've ever had (including in japan). what i liked about it was that the inside was soft but not liquid batter inside, yet had a firm exterior and a large piece of octopus inside. the ebi 
with shrimp crackers was also a personal favourite.

the service was reasonably attentive. prices were a little pricey but not unreasonable. although our group of 4 were seated right away for an early dinner i would definitely suggest reservations especially if you're a bigger group.",4

"a montreal must. excellent food and very friendly staff and the prices are reasonable: we got the lamb shank and split a plate of risotto, which they split into two plates after we asked the staff. beautiful atmosphere, feels like a little paris in montreal, so if you want a fancy french dinner you really don't need to go to the much more expensive ones in the old port. i also have to note that the portions are a good size, you won't get the tiny portions of a typical upscale restaurant. highly recommend, this is now our go-to spot.",5
"as a beatles fan, i was really looking forward to seeing this show and i was not disappointed! the beatles love is filled with songs from the beatles paired with acrobatics, dancing, singing, special effects, and much more. it was almost to the point where there was too much going on.

on a random note, the drinks that they sell in the lobby before you go into the theater are amazing. i got the ""here comes the sun"" drink and all i remember is that it was fruity and had vodka (but i couldn't taste it which i'm okay with).",5
"the only thing that bothers me about vero is their attitude that they won't let you take a pizza to-go. i get it, it tastes better there, but honestly, if i want to take it home, that's my choice.

best chinese in fountain hills.  very nice staff and great service!  large menu and everything is fresh and delicious.,4
"used to be mediocre, but now getting worse.  i've used the service occasionally over the last two years.  at first, there was always a forgotten item or two (but i was always billed for the missing items).  this required a phone call to an 800 #, a fairly lengthy wait, and then going over the entire order with the customer service rep in order to be credited for the missing items.  this problem cleared up after a while, but then there were quality issues--a leaking bleach bottle and melted ice cream were two major ones.  i stopped using them for a long time, but the emails continued, so i decided to give them one more try--it is a time-saver, and it's also good for safeway since i have to spend a minimum of $150 to get free delivery.  i placed another order on thursday, 11\/3 and checked the box for a two-hour delivery window (10 a.m. to 12 noon) on the next day, friday, 11\/4.  at 11:25 on friday morning, i had a call from the driver, saying that they were ""running late"" because of processing problems in their facility, and that my delivery would arrive ""between 12 noon and 2pm""--it arrived at 2:05pm, so i spent more than 4 hours waiting for something that was supposed to be delivered within a 2-hour window.  in addition, 3 of the items that i really needed for the weekend (18 total quantity) were not delivered--just the note ""out of stock""--so now i get to go to the store (not safeway, but a different store!) to pick up these additional items.  since saving time is what this is all about, i'm giving up on safeway delivery completely and blocking future incoming emails that the store will undoubtedly be sending in order to get me back.",1
"surprised!  this place has a great variety and is a breath of fresh air to be something different from the ordinary coffee and pastry shop.  finally something to look forward to in the morning.  tried the turkey and bacon sandwich, the ham, egg, and gruyere sandwich, the salted carmel mocha, chai creme, and some of the pastries.  nothing missed the mark.",4
"the hotel is on the 2nd floor with stairs leading up to a clean and welcoming lobby. we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who regretfully informed us that they didn't accept debit, which was all we had at the time. we had to take money out of their atm machine. however, they did honour our request for a room on the same floor as the lobby.

we had booked a double bed with shared bathroom (bring flip flops!) although there is a sink inside our room. lights were much brighter than most other hotel rooms and i appreciated that. the window was huge and could actually be opened. at first glance, the place looked clean.

so what's with the 2 stars? 1 is for the bed bugs. we found a huge one and trapped it in a cup. the extra star for the understanding and courteous receptionist. when we showed the bed bug to her, she immediately apologized and refunded us our money back.",2
"this place never disappoints! it's portions are huge, and prices are cheap, so go nuts and order whatever you like. so far my favorites are the corned beef hash and the hammered pork tenderloin. so good!",5
first time today. car wash and lunch. pretty busy but customer service was great. need to explore the menu a bit more. shared the 3 meat and 2 sides with my husband.  brisket was good as was the pulled pork. surprisingly i preferred the chicken! coleslaw was the mayo based but was watery and not creamy. potato salad was better. only tried 3 of the sauces. not a favorite yet. need to try the other 6 next time.,4
"a nice place for a quiet drink on weeknights, or for a so-intimate-you're-squashed-against-the-bass-player weekend show.

i've seen a handful of local bands play the embassy and it's a great fun time that usually ends up being a group dance party. but the embassy is a fun place for casual drinks too -- they've got a nice layout, a decent bar, and good prices.

3.  no saturday hours at phoenix branch...too inconvenient.

first time here and my expectations were exceeded.  the waffle with strawberries was delicious and not too sweet. i had three hearty pieces of bacon that were full of flavor and cooked to perfection. scrambled eggs were light and fluffy!! i've not had such a perfectly cooked breakfast in a long time (except at home ) ;). love this place !,5

"i used to be an anytime fitness member in another city, so i knew the ins and outs of the gym as a branch.  there's a decent amount of cardio machines and they are good quality.  there are free weights and strength machines as well as what they call fitness on demand where you can take a computerized class (essentially like doing a dvd at home but in their room with equipment.)  all of that is included in your membership along with access to a private shower.  

however, that's all the membership covers.  if you want to tan it's extra money, if you'd like to take a class you will shell out extra money, there's no free personal training sessions or hydro massager.

while it's okay to pay more for quality services i could not justify the $110\/month this gym wanted for my husband and i to join.  that's not with the extras.  that's just a basic membership with a year contract that you need to buy out.  remember the episode of friends where they wanted to quit the gym?  i'll stop that before it happens.

but if it's a single membership and you want convenience- this is very convenient in an easy location right off division street and hwy 19.  your 24 hour access key card makes it easy to work out on a sleepless night or if you work odd shifts.",3

"stopped in with michael f & brianna l on a friday before a badger home game at around 10pm and had a pretty good time.

of course this isnt going to be like a bar on campus and i was honestly pretty glad.  that scene is ok sometimes but others, a guy just wants to play some darts or hear flo-rida's ""low"" 3-4 times in 2 hours.

on this night, z104 was dj-ing if you could say that.  i think they had a 1.5 hour loop playing and that was about it.  drinks were fair, ~$3 for beam mixers and bottles of domestics.  bartenders were mediocre, not very friendly i'd say.  place was damn big though and it wasnt too packed.  there is still smoking in middleton remember.

crowd was quite interesting and i'd say the place's selling point.  wide variety from a large middle-aged chick with her ass hanging out of some short sweatpant material shorts to a crowd of good looking co-eds looking to just chill around a table.

i didn't end up finishing the pbs and luckily had some tupperware inside my car to pack it.

"my partner and i went to table 17 for dinner while on a visit to toronto, we both felt that this was a very good restaurant based on both food and service.

our hotel was in the financial center, so we wanted to explore a different part of toronto, and the server at another restaurant said good things about table 17. the atmosphere there is rather romantic, with candlelight and a somewhat dark setting. it's not a very large restaurant, but the small space doesn't make it too loud.

the menu we had was prix fixe with an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. since there were two of us, we were able to try a good portion of the menu, and we were rather impressed with what we got. my pork belly entree was very tasty and light.  my partner had the steak frites for entrée, and i while normally tend to stay away from steaks at a non-steakhouse (because you never know what you're going to get), this steak was tender, charred, and very well-executed.

the service was definitely a bright spot here. our waitresses very friendly and indulged all are crazy questions and requests.

overall, i would definitely recommend table 17 for either a group dinner or romantic dinner. there's one table right by the window that was open when we arrived, and we asked to sit there but the hostess said that people reserve some tables by number because they're good. if you care, that one is ...table 23. ;)",5
i've passed this place a hundred times and never had any intention of ever eating here.  my sister said she liked the subs here so i thought why not...i will try it with her.  it's been here forever and must be in business for a reason.  i ordered the lamb satay sub.  you won't be able to find a lamb sub anywhere else as far as i know.  it took awhile but it finally came.  meat was seasoned nice and tasted good.  the bread was grilled and toppings are typical but i liked the spicy mayo.  i think the meat to bun ratio is off with too much bun and not enough meat.  i think if the bread was more fresh or baked in-house and they had more topping options and gave more meat this place would be a five star.  as-is they are a 3 star in my books.,3
i like they have lactose free alternative ($1 extra). the staffs are very friendly here. and you can check in on yelp for a free topping. ;-),4

"even though it's a small shop hidden in circus circus, they serve the best crepe ever...and that's saying a lot considering i've had a lot of crepes during my lifetime. it's $10 for a huge crepe and you get to pick two toppings of your choice. add another dollar to put yogurt on the crepe. this is my second time here, and i feel like i'm going to come here every time i go to vegas from now on!",5
"the first thing i thought when i walked in to the place,  was whether i was at the right place. it looked like a japanese restaurant to me, and i confirmed the address by asking one of the hostess. the front entrance area is lined with photos with celebrities from all over the world, it looked impressive, but the place feels the opposite. 

it's required to order two portions in order to get table top bbqing. therefore, we placed an order of the pork belly ($20.99) and seafood ($22.99). the bbq came with a bean paste sauce and a little basket full of romaine lettuces that are halved. there was no raw garlics or peppers that you usually find in a korean bbq house. the meal came with 4 different ""ban chan"" (side dishes), and you have to pay if you want refills of the ban chan.

overall, the meal was mediocre, i've had better korean table top bbq in toronto. most korean restaurants provides a lot of variety of ban chan with free refills, whereas it was not the case at korean village restaurant. the service was ok. we won't be back.",2
very delicious! everything was very good. my favorite was the black dog burger with the georgia peach bbq sauce. the burnt ends were good but a pretty small app. the collard greens and sweet potato fries were my favorite sides. the applesauce and meatloaf special were overrated for me but my brother loved it! order to go if you want to have a slightly less exhausting wait.,5
"beyond rude!
omg i just came to pick up my bfs stuff and this black fucking lady with a cheap ass blonde weave, green contacts and mcdonald fucking eyebrows just yelled at me and made me fucking cry.  

she yelled at me that 1)-the package was to him 2)-we weren't legally married 3)-i didn't have his last name and 4)-that i had no business trying to pick something that didn't belong to me.  she yelled at me with the place full of customers. as i was walking away she yelled ""those are the rules!!"" i said back ""i understand there's rules but there's no need for your attitude""

i don't write complaints but i'm going to send this to customer service. i came back in and asked for her name and she said some weird name that sounded like ""daisy"" but who the fuck knows. 

oh and she's also the supervisor. as i was walking out the door she said ""if that's a complaint i don't care"" and i said ""yes it actually will be a complaint"". 

what a shitty fucking pos lady she is. 

i can't believe i cried. she said all that in front of everyone! i'm so upset. ugh 

i'm sorry about the language. this happened at the #awhatukee location on 51st st 11\/07\/15 around 12:45ish (15mins before closing, still doesn't excuse her rudeness!)

mind u, i've picked up packages before ever for my roommate!!!!!  #usps @usps #uspostalservice @uspostalservice",1
"this was one of my best food experiences of the year. this place is heaven! we didn't have reservations, so we arrived early and sat at the bar. i strongly recommend reservations because the place is not big.
the menu features small dishes to share so you can try a lot of different things. we started with the singapore slaw, that everybody raves about it. it was very tasty but it did not blow my mind like the rest. after, we had the salmon ceviche that comes in individual spoons drenched in a really tasty citrusy sauce. very delicious! then, we had lamb chops served on top of a lentil curry that was amazing. i dream about that lentil curry. we also had the tiger shrimp with a garlicky sauce. now the dessert blew me away. it was like small dim sum dumplings filled with chocolate ganache, coconut, hazelnut, peanut and sesame. amazing.
the place is not cheap but it was worth every canadian cent of it! i would go back to toronto just for that place!",5
they send me a bill for $68.74 for lab work i never authorized i called them up asked them to show me what i signed they said we don't have t show your doctor ordered it and they threatened to ruin my credit with the credit bureau i couldn't afford to ruin my credit so i paid them i filed a complaint with the attorney generals and they have an open file on sonora quest they said if they get a pattern of complaints that may lead  to  an investigation i hope some day the attorney general  shuts them down,1
they are always quick and call with a good time frame so you aren't waiting around. doug fixed problem in less than a few minutes. awesome will call again!,5
"if it weren't for the horrible service, the food might have gotten 2 stars.  there was a hostess podium outside the restaurant where we waited for 5 minutes, then realized no one was going to host us.  so we walked inside and awkwardly waited for someone to seat us. again, no one, so we had to stop a server who sat us down.  he said he'd be right with us and never came back to serve us.  a different server came by and took our drink orders, interrupting each order so he could shout it to the drink prep behind the bar.  three of us ordered food.  one order came out 15 minutes before the other two and he was nearly done eating by the time the other 2 orders came out.  his was a main course by the way and the other two were main dishes and an order of steamed dumplings.  you'd think the steam dumplings would come out first, but whatever.  the food was just ok.  i got the ramen which wasn't the best i've ever had, but clearly something you could probably get from trader joe's and heat up at home.  at around $14 per main course, this place was not worth the money.  finally, the poorly-mannered server gave us our bill and stood there and waited while i put down the tip.  i only put about 15% by the way because i was so displeased with the service.  he rudely opened the book to look at the tip in front of us and walked away.  just tacky.  the service sucks and the food is overpriced. save your money and go eat elsewhere at the linq.",1
"if you like good humor and good music in tandem, there's no better place for you to have a happy hour, celebrate a life event, or just go out for a night of entertainment than sing sing.

karl bailey presides over one of the best live music acts in the city, a rollicking extravaganza of requested music mixed with jokes and asides that keep audiences singing, clapping, and laughing along. drew and danny complement karl and all are top-notch piano guys with a deep knowledge of various songs. 

from the college fight song challenges to sung birthday burns, you won't be disappointed by this place. 

the food and beer is also excellent. sing sing serves a selection from the rock bottom brewery menu. the best is the pretzel appetizer, which comes with a helping of hot spinach dip with a kick. their pizzas and burgers are also excellent. 

the beer is straight from rock bottom next door (the brewery restaurant and sing sing are attached by a corridor) and includes a wide selection.",5
"it is absolutely fabulous in all respects- great food and drinks, fun decor, wonderful service and a super vibe all around. i have travelled throughout asia, including cambodia. i love everything on the menu at street monkeys  especially, the shrimp ceviche and the trout with tomato salsa. they also serve the best fried banana desert i have ever eaten. at most places the dough is thick but here it is light, barely there. the bonus is that they are close to the lasalle metro station so no need for a car.",5
"i would have given this place 3.5 stars, but not 4. the pizza was good, not great. interesting combinations of ingredients on most pies. couldn't have been more disappointed by the margherita pie. honestly, if you can't make a plain cheese pizza work what good are you?
the decor was nice, the waitstaff was excellent.
the wait, well let's just say it is not worth it to wait even a half hour for this stuff. go eat at parlour or cibo and you will be just as happy with no wait.
would only go here again if someone held my place in line and i could swoop in here at the last moment.
once again, hype outweighs reality.",3
"absolutely terrible service. our a\/c went out on sunday, the soonest this company could come out was tuesday. my husband received a voice mail at approximately 7:30 in the morning that the tech was on their way. my husband called the company before 8am, got their voice mail that they wouldn't be open until 8am(why was he instructed to call the number then?) at 8:05, he called again, recording stated that due to the high number of calls, there would be a long wait but he could leave a message!) we both rushed home from work so that we would be sure one of us was home when the technician arrived. at 10:00, still no technician. 10:15 my husband received a call that the tech would be there in the next 30 to 90 minutes. really??? 
the tech did arrive, confirmed what the issue was and advised my husband that the part would need to be ordered and a ticket submitted for the work to be done. now we are being told friday. the company that installed the a\/c a few years ago came out on sunday and told us what was wrong and they could do the work. unfortunately because the home warranty has an agreement with cnn, we can't use the company that installed the a\/c, unless we pay for it out of pocket. 
shame on this company and the home warranty companies. the customers are stuck with bottom of the barrel service unless the customer is willing to pay out of pocket. why have a home warranty then???",1

"this is one amazing company!  i had been searching for a pool table for months and they had my absolute dream table with an incredible low price!  we inquired about a pool table on a sunday and kevin (one of the owners) met up with us an hour later so we could view all our options.   we had a bbq planned for 4pm that day and he went ahead and loaded the table up, met us at our house about 2 hours later and set up the entire table in less than an hour!   i don't know any other billiards business that does same day set up!  the incredible low price even included delivery, set up, 4 cues, set of balls, a nine ball rack and an eight ball rack and even a wall mount for your cues!  the very nice table cover had a very reasonable low price as well!  amazing!  kevin and his brother assembled and set up the pool table perfectly and both were very professional and friendly.   they have several styles of tables and all in stock!  we were able to choose the color of our felt out of over 15 options.  they also do repairs, moving, etc.   they are bonded insured and accredited with the bbb.  we will be recommending this company to anyone and everyone and will be purchasing everything we need from them only!",5
it had been over a year since the last time we were here. the only reason we came was because of my son's fundraiser. that last time was not a great experience but this time around was different. i felt compelled to write a review. the host was friendly and sat us quickly. our server was great (unlike the sever we had last time). he was prompt and attentive. the wings were tasty and my calzone was good. overall a good experience.,4
"my meal was disgusting! i ordered the orange chicken lunch special. the orange chicken tasted old and dry, the sauce was congealed. 
the chow mein noodles were like overcooked, reheated, spaghetti noodles. they were also very bland.

"pasta, antipasti, pizza uvm, einfach alles was ein gutes italienisches restaurant zu bieten hat.
der pizzateig (den konnte ich bis jetzt nur testen) ist allerdings selbstgemacht und schmeckt erstklassig! (natürlich auch der rest... )

von der preisklasse ist alles dabei. man kann sehr gut gerichte für 6€, oder für 30€ bestellen, je nach volumen des geldbeutels und grad des hungers 
natürlich sind die mitarbeiter sehr warmherzig und freundlich, gehen aber auch untereinander nett und freundlich miteinander um, das zeigt mir, dass der laden gut organisiert ist.
zum letzten mal war ich sicherlich nicht hier, denn es lohnt sich wirklich hier mal vorbeizuschauen, oder einfach etwas mitzunehmen.

"this place got our business simply by default.  we originally had plans to meet friends for weekend brunch at another restaurant nearby.  the first choice restaurant had a wait time of 90 minutes for brunch.  that sadly wasn't acceptable with a small child.  our friends suggested calling chompie's to ask about their wait time.  we did so, learned the wait was only 20 minutes and headed there.  on the drive over, i remembered my only other experiences with chompie's were at their scottsdale location, and both experiences left me underwhelmed by both the food and the price to value ratio.

having limitations on our restaurant budget, we like to feel we got real value for our hard-earned money.  value to us does not mean filling up at the feeding trough that is golden corral or thinking fine dining is ""the"" outback, but we like to feel if we're paying $50 for brunch (without alcohol), that it was delicious or unusual.  we could have spent $50 for lunch at pappadeaux and been completely thrilled.

the best thing about our visit was the nice corner table that gave us plenty of room to be comfortable and enjoy good conversation with our friends.

the food was very lackluster.  authentic jewish deli?  hardly.  grandma yetta is rolling over in her grave thinking about their kreplach.  my husband spent almost $15 for the apple pancake with added scrambled eggs and sausage.  i went with a corned beef sandwich, as at $13, it was one of the cheaper options.  we both felt our choices were just meh, the corned beef flavorless and the apple pancake nothing special. add in a pancake kids meal, 2 soft drinks, tax and tip and we were just north of $50.

next time, i will have plenty of good suggestions for alternatives that aren't chompie's.  sadly, i think they're still impressed that they were featured on adam richman's show, which was so 2010....

(by the way, the restaurant has no control over this, but i especially loved the table of frat rats kvetching about their hangovers and dropping f-bombs like they were adderall pills at last night's rager, hello goofballs, there's an impressionable 2 year old boy right next to you, take your potty mouths back to the dorm room).",1
"we had arrived at 12 pm on a sunday and found ourselves on a bit of a wait.  the place was packed and the parking lot was as well although we managed to find a spot.   we checked in with a person at the rear entrance and we're told we would have a 20 minute wait.  we decided to go to another concept of theirs a couple feet away called churn.  it is an ice cream shop.   very good.  anyway upon finishing our ice cream they called us in and sat us on the patio.  we were greeted promptly by a nice waitress and ordered. we had a garden vegetable entree and a burger with mac and cheese.  food was wonderful, veggies were delicious.   burger was devine.  overall had had a great experience.",5
"i will reiterate what i wrote on another site for my review of this salon. horrible!  first off, it was very easy for me to get an appt w the owner (which should be difficult if they're good).  when i decided i wanted low lights they had to change my appt to 1\/2 hr later-thought that was convenient.  then when i got there, it wasn't busy at all.  most people coming in for pedicure.  i just didn't get a good feeling at all about this and should have cancelled.  from the reviews on another site everyone said how great a place this was and what a wonderful job they did. i beg to differ.  

she first asked why i only low lights and i just wanted to keep it simple and less costly..talking me into getting color. it seemed like she was working way too fast and for a first time client you would think she would take her time.  it was not a good experience at all.  the phone in the place as i recall, didn't ring and there weren't many people there.  odd.  first tip off should have been when it was just too easy to make an appt.  when she started to cut she asked how much off, i told her enough so the ends were cleaned up.  they were split a bit.  then that's where the whole trouble started. she pulled out these shears i haven't seen in a while. thinning shears!!! i have fine hair and those should not be used on my hair. my hair doesn't style well w\/ those and  i asked her nicely would she please stop using them. told her time after time they aren't good on my hair, that's when she said i thought you wanted dimension? not w\/ scissors, w\/ low lights!!!!!  she used them on my whole head after repeating what i had stated before, didn't matter.  then she took them to my bangs! i know have literally no bangs!! they are so thin (which they were already) and now it looks ridiculous. i look ridiculous.  had to call another salon to have them fix this mess. women's hair it's a person thing to us and this will take a long time to grow out.  when asked to have her check it, she seemed insulted.  another reason why i won't go back.  she didn't even check it at all.  when she did, it was so quick a joke! the whole place was saying how nice my hair looked and the color..ugh it was overkill to be honest and i think the only reason it was overdone was because they had a couple clients there.

i went somewhere else same day to have it fixed, had to repay someone else to clean up what she did.  this woman had shown me what she had to fix, the whole thing! the bangs she said just had to grow nothing she could do, she just cleaned it up as well. showed me the back, it was all uneven and chopped up. due to those shears.  she said she should have never used those on your hair type.  duh!  i was beyond upset, but what can i do? i called my credit card co to dispute the charge-i have to wait a couple days due to it's pending. i spent a of $$$$ in this place and i only want to be reimbursed for the horrible haircut i received that now has to grow out.  so glad i don't have a function that i need to attend.  don't risk it at all. not worth it by any means!!!!!",1

will be back!",4
good time. could use an update in the main room. however i think the price is just steep.,4
"i love indian food, and this place has great tasting food that is fairly priced.

my friend and i had... 

dehli fish curry, 
paneer korma, 
garlic naan, 
and this awesome rice with peas that i forget the name of!

i also had a mango lassi that was to my liki.

my absolute favorite was the paneer korma, so rich and flavourful, i'm getting serious cravings just typing about it.

the service was great, and answered all my annoying questions about this n that with grace. he even suggested that two naan might be too much and that we should start with one. stellar service!

"so i got a two for one dinner coupon and had my heart set on the fried chicken and waffles.  

damn, that portion was just ridiculous.  chicken was crisp and juicy.  even the breast meat.  i don't even remember the meatloaf but i think it was good too.  

three ladies shared that and the meatloaf entree and i swear, we could've fed our husbands\/bfs with that amount of food.

who eats this much???

"cosmic trickster, i am not amused. what are you trying to teach me? that fast food eats castor oil popsicles? did i write too many favorable reviews for chains? 

well, boston market isn't too, too bad actually. this was my first bm encounter in more than a few moons.

i used to really, really like rotisserie chickens. i still do actually. they used to be an occasional, spontaneous treat when brought home from a deli ('hey! rotisserie! let's get one!'). so when the boston market franchise first came on the scene, i was fairly excited about the prospect of getting roasted chickens pretty much whenever i wanted from a restaurant that specializes in them. no, i've never been to a kenny roger's roasters and it's been 7-8 years since i've been to a george aiken's. boston market (formerly boston chicken) has also seemingly branched out into other areas, going out of their way to offer a homey take on fast food, the idea being that you can eat a bm meal at home in your dining room with the good silverware on the good plates, reserving crazy bread or mcnuggets for the woodland critters out in the backyard. 

now the boston market chickens are tender enough (many places roast their chickens for too long), but i've always felt there was something missing from them. actually, i take that back, their chickens have a funny taste i'm not sure i like, one that suggests that i'm dining on frankenchickens or something. is it because they're frozen? not that they're awful in any way, mind you, i've just never liked their chickens as much as i feel i should. i guess the word i'm looking for is, bland?

hooray for their army of side dishes. well, they do give you a lot of choices, but like the chicken, they're mostly just passable. i usually get the green beans and the garlic dill taters, neither of which are bad nor rock my culinary socks off. but...wait...

...there's the...cinnamon apples.

these aren't a side dish. they are a dessert. i always forget how good they are until i have them, and while i'm eating them, i always imagine how good they would taste as a hot sundae topper. but i always end up eating them all before that happens and never have any ice cream around to slather the apples onto. 

why is it that we were served applesauce in school and never the almost erotically warm cinnamon apples? was the faculty afraid of corrupting us? or spoiling us? making us realize that school cafeteria fare doesn't have to suck? 

staying on the dessert track, we had an order of their chocolate brownies, free i might add with some deal, and they are actually reasonably appetizing. they are cut into triangles, which is a nice touch. instead of being heavy and gooey, they're just moist enough and very...cocoa-ish, as if you're munching on a soft oreo cookie without the white stuff. 

what do you have in store for me next, cosmic trickster? will you steer me towards the worst meal of my life, or the best? methinks this was the calm before some sort of storm. a big concert weekend approaches after all...

right now, i'm left with the remnants of a nice, safe 3 star dinner and jon stewart on the telly.",3
"...and with a few passive-aggressive words, daily dose lost one of their most loyal customers (to see just how much i have enjoyed dd's great service and wonderful food, please read my prior review, below; it's long been my favorite breakfast spot in old town).

our server was genuinely friendly and she swiftly brought out coffee, water, a couple of really yummy mimosas (it's easter morning, so why not!) and then took our order.  coincidentally, we both ordered the turkey sausage white-out omelet (four egg whites filled with turkey sausage and mozzarella... bowl or fruit & multi-grain toast on the side); another server brought them out surprisingly quickly, i mean immediately after our order, which is when things began feeling not quite right.

before i cut into the omelet, i put my finger on it because it didn't look hot, and it wasn't (it was a little warmer than room temperature); i cut a small bite -- the same, just kind of warm.  this made no sense... i had just placed the order and they just brought it from the kitchen.  before i said anything about my omelet, my friend said, ""i'm sending mine back, this isn't right"".

i cut my omelet in half and touched the turkey sausage in the middle... it wasn't frozen but it was still cool.  i asked my friend, ""restaurants don't pre-make and reheat omelets, do they?""  i thought this might explain why they came out from the kitchen so quickly and also why they weren't really hot.  she shrugged, ""i wouldn't think so..."".  

i really really really dislike being that pretentious\/entitled guy who sends back food because it's not to his liking, so when our server checked back with us i tried to politely tell her that the eggs were just barely warm and... -- before we could finish she very courteously took up both of our plates and shook her head saying, ""i'm so sorry, don't worry about it, i'll take care of it right away!"" (i wish that we'd have gotten her name so we could recommend her!)

but then, immediately thereafter, the manager on duty came over, put the palms of his hands down on the corners of our table and asked, ""so, you want your omelets scalding or what?"".  

the passive-aggressiveness of the question was so surprising that i could only think to say, ""i'm sorry?""

""i just wanted to know if you wanted them scalding,"" he replied.

i tried to explain that the omelets were just barely warm, the turkey in the middle was cold, etc., but he asserted ""i checked it in the kitchen, it was hot"".  i explained that we both thought they seemed to be reheated but he insisted, ""i picked them up in my hands, they were both hot"".

sort of stunned, i looked at my friend and said, ""then i guess we're the problem... we'll just pay for these [mimosas] and go,"" i said.

""don't worry about it,"" he said and walked away.

i put seven dollars on the table as a tip for our original server and we walked out the door, saddened about my old favorite...",2

"bww is the definition of overrated, i ate there last night with the wife for the second time and many times i had to walk away from this place since it is always so busy.  i agree that it looks like a great place to watch a game, except the seats aren't exactly comfortable.  not to mention the wings aren't even that good, i mean i wouldn't wait to eat there and i can think of many other places with better wings.  i even tried (4) different flavors just to see what i would like best, some were pretty good but it did not leave much impression.  the ranch is ok, we make ranch at home that is much better.  i did have a honey bbq bacon chicken sandwich yesterday and that wasn't too bad but my wife thought chili's could have made a better salad....she had some sort of a chicken tender salad.  the atmosphere is nice and the service was average, can't say enough about how average this place is so i am not sure what the big deal is about this place but if i would rather go to hooters to have lousy food with a better view.",2
"i am not generally big on concerts but as far as venues go this was a fantastic environment. 
when we arrived the line moved quickly because there were several people spaced out along the entrance doing separate jobs. first came the pat down, then the id checks for those who want to drink and finally the ticket scanning. i think this made everything move faster because the people at the front reminded patrons to have the tickets out and ready several times before they were needed.

as soon as you enter there is a bar on the right with a large selection and typical painful venue prices. then there is a path all the way around the stage that the bouncers kept clear the whole night. i would love if bars did this! whenever i wanted to move to another area (bar, bathroom, outside) i had minimal crowd swimming to do before i was free and clear to move about the open walkway. we spent our time at the raised deck in the back. view was a little removed but it meant we could see over everyone's head which i thought was better.

the only two downsides were that cleared the outside area abruptly before the night ended. we had gone out to cool off for a moment and then were sent almost immediately back inside in a brisk manner. the second downside was that even though there were several bars service was slow.

*protip - going all the way along the side to get to the left hand stage before the bathrooms is a fantastic view of the artist. you can't stand and gawk because they keep the path clear but you can definitely get a quick view and pic!",4

"as many times as i've binged on cupcakes here, i've gotta give a shout out to this place. cupcrazed is literally the best cupcake shop i've ever found - and believe me, i've familiarized myself with many! ;). my husband and i always brag on it, and whenever we bring guests here, they always agree.

i love the extensively creative varieties offered, the large size of the cupcakes, the generous frosting and fillings...it all adds up to make these a step above. even the few that i've tasted that weren't on par (drier texture or not as much filling as preferred) were still better than cupcakes i've tried at other well renowned shops.

i appreciate that the cupcakes not only look beautiful, but - most importantly - their taste is absolutely delicious as well. maybe one of these days i'll actually remember to pause long enough to take a picture of them!  keep up the great work and creative ideas, cupcrazed!",5

waited over 5 minutes for someone to even notice us. then was told that they didn't know if they could seat us which was only three people total me my wife and daughter. at that point i noticed only one table with there food and everyone else looking upset. the girl told me to hold on she needed to ask her manager while i'm looking at 4 open tables she left and so did i will not be coming back to this location,1
"the food court here may as well be entirely theirs (at one point it nearly was, but they decided to go back to its original size), since that's what almost everyone in here is for, and for a good reason too.

lots of choices to the point it's overwhelming at times, food is served quick, tastes good for it's value (most food can be paid for with a $5 bill), and you get a lot of it. yep, all checks out for a good fast food place. now if only they'll do something about those weak forks\/knives they give...",3
"when you walk in there is no doubt, this is a dive. you sit at the bar, if the woman is serving you, she is as dry and cold as it gets. that my friends, is the ambiance. and i absolutely love it! the japanese man who usually is behind the bar is amazing, and funny, if you can understand him. the helper guy that occasionally comes out is like a japanese corky, but he cuts the sushi thicker than the other two, so i like when he comes out. they are understaffed, sometimes you have to remind what you want a couple of times. but this is classic ayce. they were part of the 4 store group that brought ayce sushi to vegas. this wasn't my favorite place, but my favorite place closed. there are other places i like, one offers tapas on top of sushi, but when i just want fish, this is the spot. so if you can get over the 20 year old paint on the walls, and the lack of decor, and want great sushi, this is your spot. and they are a couple bucks cheaper than the competition.",5
"yeegads! i just learned that modern steak closed its doors as of today, may 25, 2013! 

how could that be? it is a day of mourning for sure.  

there always seemed to be plenty of folks anxious to spend a little quality time with a chopped salad, or some of their other tasty menu items. i hope some of the menu items will be transferred to one of their other locations. please.

we will miss some of the excellent staff at modern steak. they were the best. 

bummer. bummer, bummer.",5
"food is consistently good.  this place has been in business for more than 20 years and it is easy to see why.  meals are individually prepared and are delicious.  servers have stayed for many years.  service is friendly and good.
expect crowds at dinner time, as there are repeat customers, in addition to ""newbies.""  the garlic rolls are to die for, but are only served at dinner time.",4
"5 stars for decor\/urban feel and location 
3 stars for parking (parking garage)

1 star for the menu. (very small .. very..) 
2 stars for speed of food coming out 
1 star for portion sizes ($7 for one kids pancake.. as in one single pancake, lol) 
1 star for prices. (a little overpriced) 


overall, a very cool spot!",3
over an hour on a tuesday night around 9 pm to get cold food and a still frozen dessert delivered. they didn't even get the dipping sauces right.less than six blocks away from the restaurant.,1
"my best friend moved across the street from this place so we decided to go and explore the area. came across the badger cafe and decided to check it out. as soon as we walked in, a guy waiting for his order probably instantly knew we had never been there before. he then told us ""best burgers in vegas. been coming here for years"". so we sat down because it's self seating. the waitress we had was super sweet and friendly. i did order soft shell tacos but got the hard shell. the waitress apologized and offered to fix it real quick but it wasn't a big deal for me.

the taco was just like any other tacos. nothing special. my friend got a burger and he said it was alright like any other burger.

i'll probably be coming back for the customer service more than the food when i want something in the area.",4
"we stopped today to try the baked goods.  holy insulin shot, batman!!  the icing has so much sugar in it, it actually crackles when you break the surface.  the cake part was good, but wow...i had to scrape of all the icing first.  similar with the oatmeal cream pie.  cookie was good (but very sweet) and same with the ""cream"" inside (sickeningly sweet icing).  the samoan bar was ok (lots of coconut, which was very nice).",2
"my friends and i have decided that instead of the strip, we are going straight to the m next time!

mmmmmmmm...

this place is great!  looks pricey, but definitely affordable for any tourist coming back.  the inside decor is astounding, and makes you feel like you're really living the high life.

casino is great!  i got lucky my first time during slots here, and another great part is that there are complimentary self-serve soft drinks and water.  sure you can get drinks from the waitresses that walk by, but this one requires no tipping (and is a good alternative if you aren't big on drinking but still want a light refreshment while playing craps).

buffet........
amazing!  it is mmm mmmmm good!  for weekdays it is $25, and on weekends it is $30 with seafood options.  not to say that during the week day there aren't, but man, this was probably my favorite affordable buffet in vegas.  there are so many options, including juicy prime rib and nigiri sushi (salmon, yellowtail and tuna), along with other delicacies.

one of the best parts of the buffet?  unlimited drinks!!  but of course, tip accordingly, and you won't have the stomach to get drunk from the booze since you'll be eating so much delicious food at the same time.

there is also a great wine cellar downstairs that serves as a wonderful lounge.  you can sample wines ($2-$15) and really live the good life here.

definitely a must-experience while in vegas.",5
divine eatery is a hidden gem. the food is delicious and everything is made fresh. i had the byo omelette and tried the nutty french toast. both were amazing...i can't wait to come back!,5
"i ordered a white almond half sheet with chocolate buttercream, and the cake itself was very light and flavorful, just as i would expect from an italian bakery. the frosting was decent, but it didn't have a very rich chocolate taste as i would prefer.",4
"we were in the area, and stopped at this target.  i was expecting it to be a bit over-run based on location.  but wow, it was really well stocked!  it was clean, staff friendly...took me directly to the item i was looking for!  and they had checkouts down to a science, no lines - friendly people seeing you were ready and saying, i can open a lane for you!!! we'll be back.... perhaps this is much better than the mayfield heights one!!!  the parking lots was not full, we didn't have to walk a mile with -5 degrees temperature.",5
we had made an appointment for a pedicure and manicure for three.  we all had the best treatment of our lives!  i usually get a pedi\/manicure every three weeks.  this was the first time we went to blue sky nails&spa.  i will come back any time in the future!   i can highly recomend this place!,5
"this restoration hardware embodies pretty much everything that i dislike about the stereotypical scottsdale business. it oozes pretension (what furniture store needs their own valet parking, especially when the parking garage is literally right across the street from it?), with salespeople that won't give you the time of day if they don't consider you worthy of shopping there. i passed by at least 3 salespeople who walked by, ignoring me.

i walked in and looked at all the furniture. every single piece had the same drab, linen-pale-beige, burlap-sack colored fabric on it. from the looks of it (and since no salesperson deigned to talk to me to let me know otherwise), it seemed like the furniture upholstery only came in this color, and in this linen-like, sack-like fabric. i know now after looking at the website that there are actually a multitude of fabrics and colors to choose from. why would they put the same exact, pedestrian shade and fabric on all their furniture, on all 3 floors? variety is good! it lets customers know that your furniture is customizable!

the only person there that actually talked to me was their valet, who thanked me and wished me a good day even though i didn't use their services. their salespeople could take some lessons in customer service from him!",2
"it takes somthing special to make a good veggie sub, most places jut take a normal sub and throw away the meat, and some times if you are lucky add an avacado.  this was the case here. just some lettuce pickle tomato and cheese. 

the bread and cheese were decent but overall the sandwitch lacked any insperation, sprouts, a pesto, grilled portobello etc would have been nice ways to add some flavor and substance, alas, my quick meal selection left me disappointing and hungry and the price was aceeptable at ~$6 but not great.",3
first time using yelp and chose this place to try...  parking was on the side of the business and across the street.  it was hard to locate enterance (thankfully someone was outside to tell us where to go)   ordering is a la cart..the food was absolutely delicious! great flavors.. i would definitely eat there again,5
theres always a machine or two that dont function and the fact that the front girl never looks up at you to say high kinda sucks when youre walking in there at 6am,3
"i was looking for a nail parlor that was close-ish to my area, and this place by far had the best and most consistent reviews. called to make an appointment to do my gel nails, and the man on the phone was very clear about directions. upon arriving there i can absolutely see why people might get lost. they're tucked into the back of a complex on rose garden lane. easiest way to get there would be to turn and go east onto rose garden lane and then turn left (north) into the red brick complex. they're straight ahead of you there. 

it's a nice new place, and was pretty busy when i got there, even though it was 1000 on a saturday and they had only opened at 0900. most people were actually there for pedis. since i had an appointment i was seated almost right away, and they got down to removing my previous gel manicure and get a new one on me.

i do have to make a disclaimer- i hadn't always had a great experience with gel nails. i did them for my wedding and loved them, and went back to get them done after they grew out, for a bachelorette party in vegas. the removal process was horrid- they used this thing to scrape the stuff off and it felt awful. and then i left, went shopping and literally in an hour had a giant chip. of course there was no time to go back and get it fixed. it was a very disappointing experience.

but getting mine done when i was out of town had been pleasant, and my best friend said she was addicted to them. so i decided to give it a shot again. 

and i'm glad i did. the removal process here was quick and painless- the gel manicure crumbled off when it came time to scrape it off, no awful sensations necessary. they had a great range of colors, and my lady even tried to recommend another color for me. (i wound up sticking with the color i wanted). the nails were beautifully done, and she did them promptly- i was in and out of the place in under an hour. i did decide to wait about a week to do a review, to see how well these puppies wear. the manicure i had prior to this chipped a bit on the thumbs within a week, which was also a bit disappointing.

a week and these nails look as good as they did when i left the salon. i'm hard on my nails too- i pound at a keyboard, and have two big, rough dogs at home. these still look great- no chips, wonderful shine. 

i think i might have found my newest addiction, and i'll definitely be back to get them done again! 

please do note that you can pay with debit cards, but not credit. also, like several reviewers noted below- bring cash to tip.",4
"outlet pc is an amazing store! they have amazing electronics at great prices! really love going in there and seeing jonas, elton, and austin. great guys! thanks again for the great service guys 5 stars all the way!",5
"walked down from my hotel to this fashion square area restaurant. as always, on that quest to find interesting places to eat when traveling.

i would say that the culinary dropout was both interesting and had pretty good food to boot. the place has a young feel to it and the servers and bartenders could just be the most attractive (and i'm talkin' men and women here folks) collection i've ever seen working in one restaurant. 

i grabbed a seat at the bar ordered a drink and decided on a caesar salad to start followed by rainbow trout for dinner. the salad came in a chilled bowl, had both romaine and kale in it and a more lemony than garlicky dressing that had a nice tart bite to it. the addition of kale was good and allowed me to text home and tell my wife i was eating a superfood for dinner to try and score some health points! 

the trout came in a hurry, too much of one really, and was a large double filet with crisp skin, toasted almonds, green beans and some carmelized onions. it was moist and tasty though it was somewhat unevenly salted. the green beans on it were cooked just right and added a great crunch. 

beyond the pacing problems with the salad and entree coming out on top of each other, this was a nice meal and i would not hesitate to try it again.",4
"nice place. but food was inconsistent, varying from nice, and good, to ""you must be kidding"". service was attentive, but not at all competent. steak and salad stood out, all other sides, drinks, wine and desserts were poor at best. everything seemed to have an up-charge, butter for baked potato, that is extra, sour cream, extra, etc etc we won't be back",2
"i came here with my peruvian husband and we were both very impressed! the food is amazing! 
the decor is casual but quality, and the staff was really nice! we'll definitely come back here for more authentic peruvian food! 
try the lucuma ice cream!!",5
"to be honest, if there was a way to give 2.5 stars, i'd give it, but i think others' reviews praise this restaurant a little too much.

to sum it up, if the dishes were half price, i wouldn't consider going back from a value standpoint.

that's not to say the food was bad, it was.......acceptable. it wasn't anything spectacular, what you would expect a 4 or 5-star restaurant to offer.

the portions of meat per order of bbq are small when you consider how much you're paying for it, and even though they do give you a lot of side dishes, they're not of top quality.

i don't think i'd be able to honestly recommend this place to others, there are far better in the christie & bloor intersection in koreatown.",2
"first time trying this place ! it was all chance since it's on my walk to school everyday - i needed to get a haircut quickly and decided to give the institute a call! they were able to fit me in the same day.
i booked with someone who is about to graduate .. so not beginner level but i think it's called  intermediate, i completely forgot the tier names-  but they have different professional levels to choose from \/ which varies the price as well of course.. and the amount of time a service will range from. i found that it took probably about 15 mins longer than a normal haircut but completely worth it ! my hairdresser was very attentive and knew exactly what i wanted .. also the service begins with a massage & they offer you complimentary tea\/coffee it was a very nice touch. all in all i love how my hair turned out ! 
and already booked my next app with them .",5
virgin america gates not far from security check in. plenty of seating and eateries nearby. flying in on a sunday and out on a thursday the place wasn't crowded so it made fpr a pleasant travelling. vegas vibe throughout the airport including slot machines in the baggage claim area.,4
"if you want to experience montreal poutine in all it's fat and glory, this is definitely the go to place of the city. it's open 24\/7 and when we went around midnight it was still super busy and we had to wait in line for quite a bit. but it wasn't a boring wait, so i didn't mind. the atmosphere was loud and upbeat and everyone seemed to be enjoying their night and anxiously waiting for their poutine. we got the regular size which is decent sized and i have no idea how so many couples got the large and managed to finish it. (such as the couple next to us). it perplexes and amazes me. anyway the poutine was great (as expected) and i especially loved the fresh chunks of cheese curds. my only complaint is that the fries were weak and puny (can you describe fries like that..), or we just got the bottom of the stash. overall great great place to get your montreal poutine fix, ha.",4
"lone mountain discovery park is a neighborhood park that is a gateway to lone mountain. it sits in the northwest part of the las vegas valley off jensen street between alexander street and lone mountain road. the scenery is more old west than sun belt city.this is a part of las vegas that resembles a scene from ""the waltons"" more than a scene from ""oceans eleven"". lone mountain discovery park is surrounded by desert and ranch homes that sit on large lots. this is a neighborhood where the natural landscape keeps back the hyper development along the 215 freeway and craig road (westernmost point is at the park). it is no discovery that if you add a stunning mountain to the landscape that you have a winning park.

   lone mountain discovery park celebrates lone mountain. it is connected to a perimeter trail that encircles lone mountain. this park is a gateway to lone mountain hiking. at the back of the park in the shadow of lone mountain, a right turn on the perimeter trail leads to the trail that climbs up to lone mountain summit. follow the perimeter trail to the north facing of the mountain, and when the 215 is to the right, the trail up to the summit will be on the left. at the back of the park, a left turn on the perimeter trail connects to steep trails that lead to caves. the perimeter trail is also a special place for a hike or jog around lone mountain.

   lone mountain discovery park is also a nice neighborhood park in the shadow of lone mountain. there are plenty of picnic tables (unfortunately with graffiti carved in), trails for walking a dog, and a playground for children. the star of the park is the close up vista of lone mountain.

  i use lone mountain discovery park as my base for a hike to the summit of lone mountain and a hike around lone mountain. there is the perception that the activity here makes it a less risky place to leave my vehicle than the much closer trailhead at the end of vegas vista. i feel that the extended scenic hike to lone mountain increases the anticipation of the climb and acquaints me with lone mountain. if i am getting all this exercise climbing up a mountain, the extended walk is no sweat (not literally). before and after the hiking, i enjoy relaxing at a picnic table.

   i recommend driving a distance to lone mountain discovery park when it is used as a gateway to hiking up or around lone mountain. it is not a discovery that a neighborhood park that is the hub of a trail that encircles a mountain is worthy of 4 stars. and it is no discovery that lone mountain discovery park is worthy of a place in the ""vegas is sun city "" list.",4

"want good diner food, but not starving?  big bear offers items on their ""a little less "" menu

during lunch break some co-workers and i were looking for a place that had something to offer everyone, and black bear fit the bill.

it's a homey atmosphere with lots of bear paraphernalia and a newspaper menu.  it's seen better days but was certainly packed at lunchtime.

i went for the patty melt and while it wasn't the worst i've had it wasn't that great either.  kinda bland. 

what i really like is that instead of the typical french fries or onion rings on the side, you can have a cup of soup instead.  as with the patty melt, the chicken soup was average.

i have to admit i'm curious about the chicken fried steak after reading another review.  i may have to try it one of these days, but i won't go out of my way to get there.",3
"we stopped in during a road trip because of the triple d review. cognizant we weren't guy fieri,nor was he with us during our stop for our food to go. however,we were hoping something as basic as onion rings wouldn't be over cooked.my college greasy spoon never over cooked them for my orders.fries,they entirely omitted this from our order,really odd since we paid for these as the rings  already came with the combo. the lamb,portions were quite small for the price paid,but cooked properly .three stars because the server at the bar was nice,and for the food we received that didn't have an issue : lamb, kefta,various appetizers.",3
"wow. this is the craziest grocery store i've ever seen.

first, you must consider a visit here an adventure. it is the big lots of grocery stores...or better, the goodwill of grocery stores. it has a lot of stuff, never the same things twice, and you certainly never know what you'll find.

parking is south of the store; drive through the gates, and go about 100 yards from the street. carts are outside the building, at the bottom of the ramp.

the first part of your adventure is the frozen meat department. i'm rather picky about freezer burn, so even though i have gotten some good whole frozen chickens here, i must admit i fed them to my dogs (raw food feeders -- this place is fantastic!). you'll also find dairy in this section, but...caveat emptor.

pass through the hanging strips of clearish rubber to get to another part of the warehouse. the produce is behind the grocery section. i've seen some good berries and lettuce in here, but i've also seen some things that look worse than what you'll normally find in the forgotten bottom drawers of my fridge. it isn't pretty.

the main part of the warehouse is grocery itself -- cans, boxes, bottles. you'll find a lot of scratch and dent products. i've found some great prices on perrier here, and once in a while i'll find something else that i couldn't possibly get at such a great price at another store.

i believe they take debit cards, cash, and welfare food vouchers. i'm not sure if they take credit cards.",2
"shoe fetishists welcome! i enjoyed a fun, intoxicated evening finding all of the stilettos in the cosmopolitan and taking photos with them. i also enjoyed the random pool tables and sparkly chandeliers. the price isn't so bad for what you get, especially considering the location and the newness of the hotel\/casino. i would stay here in a heartbeat.",4
"i don't understand the negative reviews... my experience with lawrence's was superb from start to finish.  i had searched and searched all the furniture stores, as my budget was tight and my tastes were specific.  i went in lawrence's kind of as a last resort because i know they're pricey.  when i found the warehouse liquidation part, i was extremely happy.  i found the perfect sofa - price & style were exactly what i needed.  i found a bedroom set that was also just perfect.  i paid half and they informed me when the furniture was in. i wasn't in a huge hurry, so the couple of weeks i had to wait were acceptable.  i did not have them deliver, but their warehouse guy helped us load up.  the furniture is really quality stuff with no flaws or issues. 

the staff at the store is awesome. daniel was my sales guy and he was more than patient and helpful to me.  the dog in the store is a precious animal who adds charm and a warm touch.  

i would not hesitate to recommend lawrence's to anyone - in fact, i've already recommended them to everyone i talk to!  great job, lawrence & the gang - keep up the good work.  i'm more than happy, and will be back for bar stools and another chair!!",5
"the short rib fried rice is to die for.

i usually call in and pick up my order at the door - there is limited indoor seating, and a lot of the ""indoor"" seating is actually on a covered back patio with no heating. if you call in, the food is usually ready within 20 minutes.

i would highly recommend the short rib fried rice paired with the tri-colored curry.",5

"i just had the worst breakfast and lunch bagel sandwich's in my life.  the bagels do not taste fresh...dry!  
i had reuben sandwich and also an egg with cheese sandwich - positively the worst i ever had.  i was in a hurry and starving so i ate most of it... but it was an unpleasant chore.  :(  i know bagel sandwiches, and usually they are a real treat - but not here.  i am from back east and a true bagel shop's sandwiches are lushously mouthwatering - to-die-for delicious.  not here!  save your money and go elsewhere.",1
delicious blueberry muffins and lots of other cake\/bakery options as well. chocolate chip cheesecake was also delicious. probably a great place to order a specialty cake.,4
"amazing food!!
walked in to an empty house with only a few guest. quickly seated and treated by a really nice waiter. he was well versed on the menu options, some of which weren't listed on the menu. 
the bread the bring to the table is garlicky and super delicious. our food was just as delicious as it sounded on the menu. my chicken was perfectly cooked with generous portion of cheeses. it was perfectly spiced with a nice crunchy outer crust. can't wait to go back!",5
"i could only give this place a 4 because i didn't eat or drink there - i only enjoyed the music.  but that really is the focal point here.  the music and pianos are awesome.  everyone that is there is enjoying listening, singing, or dancing along.  the guys knew a plethora of songs and genres that most people knew.  and of course if you didn't know them, well, you could blend in easily.  

try to show up early because standing the whole time with no choice isn't a whole lot of fun.  plus having a table and chair help assure your space.",4

"very cool atmosphere! it is dark with curved wood walls and has red\/orange lighting. it creates an intimate feeling. we went for a late night dinner after a show. the waiter we had was very average. he explained the menu and the portion sizes. after we gave him our orders, he appeared to be far more concerned about the bigger party tables then the two of us.  when i looked around the restaurant, it appeared that all the tables with 5 or more people got far more attention. besides that, the food was outstanding (i had the ny steak and my wife had the burger). the meat was seasoned with perfection and the side sauces were of equal quality in accent taste. we shared the twice-baked potatoes and they were excellent, as well. the place would have received 5 stars if the service had been better.",4
"ordered my food and had uber eats deliver. i ordered the starter sampler and made it very clear in caps no mushrooms severely allergic!! guess what they did, sent my food with mushrooms in it, then when i called about it the chef had the nerve to get on the phone and tell me ""it's fried so usually when fried it wouldn't contaminate the food."" wtf usually isn't good enough when it comes down to my life!! i told them straight up if i have a reaction i'm suing, then all of a sudden they want to make it ""right"" after arguing with me for 5 minutes to just take it out the container and eat the remaining food. never will i order from here again!!",1
"i have been to tokyo express a couple of times.  i value authentic ethnic food, and this seems like an americanized fast food joint.  i do have to say this is a step above a panda express.  i have tried the teriyaki chicken with white meat and sushi.  i will never get sushi here because it tasted like the fish was spoiled.  i asked for another serving, and they gave me something else for free instead.  the teriyaki chicken is pretty decent.  i think some of my friends have tried the eel, and they have seemed to enjoy it.

if you want quick americanized japanese food, this is a decent place.",3
"at the recommendation of a couple in our group, ten of us descended upon this gem of an italian restaurant last night.  what a great experience!

it's exterior is unprepossessing, though efforts have been to make it stand out from it's more commercial neighbors with huge pots of colorful flowers and a cleanly swept entry, but pass over the threshold and you have entered a casually elegant restaurant that hints at it's european roots without hitting you over the head with checkered tablecloths and wax-dribbled chianti bottles.  

we met up in the bar, which is very handsome with shimmering bottles up-lit behind the bar and lots of comfy seating---both stools and high-tops.  the bartender was warm and courteous.  after collecting our starter beverages (dh had the house cab and i the house pinot---both very good!), we were led back to our very own private dining room where we could talk and laugh as loudly as we'd like without disturbing the other diners.   a long, narrow-ish room, there were windows on either side---to one side, looking out on the landscaping and the other into the dining room, so we didn't feel isolated at all---just special!  it was a wee bit chilly so a gas fire was dancing on the hearth at one end while a fountain burbled on the other---the feng shui rocked!

other reviewers have complained about the service---what are they talking about?  johnny, our server, was fantastic.  lots of personality, professional, knew the menu, and showed admirable patience because couples had ""mixed"" so he had to track who went on which ticket, a task he accomplished with aplomb.

dh and i shared a capreze salad.  now a capreze salad is pretty basic---tomato, mozzarella, basil, dribbled with balsamic vinegar.  but all the ingredients were very fresh and bursting with flavor and the presentation was beautiful.

i ordered the special---a massive veal chop layered with a slice of eggplant and then laid over with a blanket of melt-y, gooe-y cheese.  it was supposed to have marinara served on it but i asked for the red sauce on the side because i am not a huge tomato sauce fan and i like to be in control of it.  to accompany, i had the choice of veggies or pasta.  i chose the veggies.  the chop was perfectly cooked, so moist and toothsome with the perfect amount of crisp breading.  the marinara sauce---am i really saying this?---was really good!  not too sweet, not too tangy, nicely seasoned and the perfect texture.  the veggies were cooked to the point they were tender with such a hint of bite----the plate was dominated by carrots and i might have liked a bit more broccoli, but that's a minor quibble.  i ate and ate and ate and still had a healthy portion to bring home.

dh got the chicken parmesan.  that's his go-to dish for judging an italian restaurant.  (sort of like chiles rellenos are mine for mexican!)   he said it reminded him of the chicken parm he enjoyed several times at a favorite restaurant on the amalfi coast when we visited italy----need i say more?  dh was very, very pleased with his meal.  he, needless to say, had no leftovers to bring home!  

the other eight members of our party ordered a variety of dishes---one ordered the chicken martini, la prima's signature dish, and dh says he'll get that next time.  another had a veal marsala that looked so delicious i almost---almost!---regretted my chop for, it looked so good.  another ordered the ciopinno, bursting with mussels, shrimp, salmon, clams....  everyone had something different.  as dh said, we were cheerful, noisy group until the plates were delivered and then the table fell nearly silent except for moans of appreciation as everyone enjoyed their meals.

johnny offered a wonderful dessert menu, but we were all replete, so the ten of us all finished our meals with cappuccino that was accompanied by a lovely biscotti cookie, and the owner of la prima donna was thoughtful enough to offer to us all glasses of port to partner with our coffees.

did i mention that the owner\/chef---i believe his name is gino---stopped by our table?  you can see his passion and love for what he is doing in word and action.  the couple who suggested la prima donna said that he has been chef in some of the finest restaurants in phoenix before opening the doors of la prima donna.

all-in-all, a very good dining experience and one dh and i look forward to repeating soon.  thank you johnny and gino and all our friends for a really enjoyable evening!

i happily recommend la prima donna to all my fellow yelpers!",4
"as a belated birthday present, i wanted to take my sister to a nice restaurant of her choice.  she read about mon ami gabi and wanted to try their breakfast so we made our reservation via open table for december 27th at 10 am.  when i made the reservation, there was a box i could write a note to the maitra d'.  i wrote we're celebrating my sister's belated birthday and she wanted to have the breakfast at mon ami gabi.  hoping we could order a dessert and i could ask them for a candle or something for her but when we get there, we're never asked about it at all. 

we were there a few minutes early.  i don't know how long she's been working for that day but the hostess at the door wasn't very welcoming and didn't even crack a smile.  the popular patio was wide open and it was a very nice morning so we decided to have a table out there.  she took us to the very end of patio where nobody was around, even though only less than 20% of tables were occupied at the patio.  it was still chilly and the heating pole wasn't lit yet.  when we asked her about it, she said it should be turned on soon and she left.  i was worried if our first experience at mon ami gabi would be like her, stuck up with a horrible attitude.  however our waitress came immediately after the hostess left and told us this spot would be too cold for us and the heating pole was not working so she moved us to the right in the center where we're surrounded by three working heating poles.  if i were a manager or the owner of the restaurant, i would hire someone at least smiles for the ""greeting"" hostess.  i say the first impression is very important.

unlike the unfriendly hostess at the door, our waitress was fantastic.  she was very friendly and attentive, she made the rest of our m.a.g. experience so much better.

the coffee was pretty good, not too weak but not too strong or bitter.  their fresh squeezed orange juice was also good.  i've ordered their crab eggs benedict with breakfast potatoes and my sister ordered chicken and cheese crape.  when i saw my eggs benedict's potion, i was not sure if it would fill my big tummy but it did.  i didn't see the big chunk of crab meat but it sure did taste like crab and the buttery home fries (breakfast potatoes) were tasty too.  my sister's crape had some brie cheese in it and had a very elegant taste.  

we're too full to order any desserts but i still wished if they asked me if i wanted to do something for my sister. 

by the end of our breakfast, the patio tables were completely full.  it was too early for bellagio's fountain show but still it was fun to watch people who past by.  at least we had three or four people who shouted ""viva las vegas!"" or something like that during our 1.5 hrs or so dining time and i thought there were more variety of fun and wacky people out there than my hometown los angeles.     

the food was good if not exceptionally great.  with the patio seating and the great service we've got from our waitress, we'll be back for breakfast or lunch.",4
third vehicle i've taken at this location this week. i've only taken them there because of the inexpensive oil changes. if you only want the outside of your vehicle cleaned take it here. they do a terrible job cleaning the inside. third vehicle this week i've taken home and had to clean the inside myself.,2
great and first vape shop in pmall great juice selection and they finally take debit now way to go.,5
"after returning from holiday to discover my apartment had bed bugs as most people i was horrified. i'd had them once before about 3 years ago & had an absolutely terrible experience with a local exterminator & wound up doing all the work myself plus shelling out nearly a thousand dollars. after reading about anthony on yelp i was eager to get his opinion. he came over and i was immediately put at ease by his kind, non-judgmental & empathic demeanor. he delicately & carefully inspected my entire apartment, turning over all furniture & peeling over my bed. he confirmed i did have a mild case of bed bugs & showed me the evidence. i was initially leaning towards heat just because of my bad experience with chemicals but he carefully described in detail why this would be more cost efficient & best suited to my needs. he did not try to sell me anything & was both an excellent listener & communicator. he came & did my place, even taking the time to carry all the bags i'd mistakenly left outside. i left him a key which he promptly delivered to me at my job for my convenience. he was patient & accommodating with my method of payment and answered all my questions in great detail. i would highly recommend anthony to anyone suffering this horrible infestation!! i am so glad i found him on here & if i ever have issues he will be the first i contact. so far i'm fairly confident my bug issue is remedied & to that i owe him all my thanks & gratitude!",5
"loved this place!! my husband and i were up on the west side of town for the evening and just happened across this place. walked in and were greeted right away and sat us at the sushi bar. one of the sushi chefs introduced himself as ken. very friendly. asked if it was our first time in. we had a few rolls, the dj roll and the sunrise roll, plus my hubby ordered the blue fin special. i am not a huge fan of straight sushi\/negiri and i thought it was fantastic!!
after we had finished, ken made us a special roll. no idea what it was called, but it had crab and scallops with sriracha and fried sweet potato strings on top. that roll was off the charts! i would request that roll again in a heartbeat! everything we ate was fantastic! great food, great customer service. awesome awesome awesome :)",5
"consider me a big fan!  

i was perusing potential spots for dinner last night and then i saw my t's picture of the 5 spice game hen and it..was...on.  they bake the game hen and then deep fry it!  why don't more spots bake and then fry things?  it tasted even better than it looked.  the side of tomato rice was really good too.  i almost never rave about eating bird but i will be having this again.   

another favorite was their shaken beef salad.  i was shaken up after my first freakin bite!  the beef was so juicy and so tender and only $12!  the hot grilled beef mixed with the cool lettuce, onion, tomato and spices made for one of the best salads i've had in recent memory. 

the mekong river noodle soup was just ok.  it looked great and was filled with lots of fixings like fish balls, pork tenderloin, quail eggs, veggies and shrimp but the pork based broth fell short for me.  i saw a lot of customers going for the bone marrow soup and holy shit what a spectacle that was.  huge bones!  me would feel like caveman and raise bone like champion (grunt!).  check out the pics of it.  

but man oh man so much other stuff i want to try like the slow braised pork belly entree, crispy bird nest noodle and more shaken beef!  they're located in the old cravin cajun spot so it's great for groups.  i hope they get their liquor license soon.",4
"the porch is a definitely different place. it fits in oakland well because it is a different place. they have healthier\/organic options. i usually only get their caesar salad when i've gone there, and that's only been like 2 times. i'd try it there again. the first time i went was before there was12 issues of e coli at the porch, the situation was fixed  and then we went back awhile after that issue.",2
"anyone who has tried this place and didn't like their creations has a stick up their hindquarters. it is way better than that freezerburned nightmare that also inhabits mill ave (shudder). the baked bear is delicious, their warm cookies and brownies have the best ice cream sandwiched between and i have yet to find their match. definitely a place to take out of towners and indulge in their life changing sandwiches!",5
"i've been coming here to study for the past few days with my friends because it's such a nice environment! there are outlets for charging computers and free wifi. the seating area is a little small and i've seen people have to leave after getting their drinks because there wasn't any space left. it's surprising to see many customers stay for long periods of time because they're so absorbed in their ""work."" i guess the environment is quite motivating! the drinks are also super affordable and different from other drink places. i've been seeing a lot of people get the clouds and frozen cotton candy, it looks amazing and i want to try it some time! i've been trying new drinks but so far my favorite is the scarlet iced tea, i definitely recommend it for someone who enjoys sweet hibiscus teas. since this place is so close to home, i know i'll be coming in often for drinks and staying to work on homework or study!",5
"my state card's annual expiration was approaching so i dropped an email and received a quick response with a...wait for it...wait for it....4\/20 appointment!  how cool is that?

arrived a few minutes early for paperwork (which, by the way, seems more extensive than it was a year ago) and as one might expect, it took about an hour to get into the doctor's exam.

doctor was very nice and non-judgy; office staff very pleasant and efficient.  they gave me a $25 break because i still had a few days left on my card.  the outrageous state fee of $150 remains and if you're not a visa or mastercard holder, the ^&%$@# in charge of the program have deemed that you are not worthy of relief.

one matter worth mentioning:  do they need a blaring fox 10 t.v. with panels of blathering botoxed bimbos and screaming mindless audience members and countless commercials driving the entire waiting room to the point of distraction presumably because it was the choice of someone behind the counter?

perhaps some relaxing music or at least some thoughtful program discussing relevant matters of the day like, oh, i don't know...the fact that we have an elfin racist attorney general about to shut the whole medicinal program down!",3
"25 cent wings!!!!!! 12am-6am. 

get ready for a wait.. i fell asleep waiting by a slot machine. and get ready for more waiting inside.. we ended up dropping a $20 and leaving after our meal.. that was probably a really big tip but we didn't want to wait. 

despite the long wait and pretty crappy service... i can't get over the 25 cent wings. yum.",4
"went with a friend once. service was alright, bread was good, sides were good. oddly enough, the worst part of the meal were the steaks - they weren't seasoned evenly or cooked very well. 

i'd try it again sometimes, but i wouldn't get a steak there.",3
"another great little spot in old town glendale! clean, cute decor with a vintage vibe, good prices on wine, and can cork the bottle to go if you don't finish. there is also a nice outdoor patio in the back of the weather is nice. my husband and i like this spot a lot!",4
"this place a great selection of margaritas and tequilas. unfortunately, our margaritas came to us room temperature (maybe a little cooler but definitely not cold) but they were pretty good anyway. the chips were great, the rest of the food was fine. not the best mexican food in town but definitely the best selection of margaritas and tequilas.",3
"we saw roger waters here.  i still not know if it's because we had floor seats, but all the seats seemed to have a great view.  snacks and drinks were way overpriced.",4
"with the warm and friendly staff and the thoughtful attention to detail, my experience at a harmony was one of a kind. i am very happy about how my mani-pedi turned out too. i am very picky about how i like it done, and it is perfect!!",5
"i agree with everyone on this post. this is the worst cfa i have ever been to and it sucks because it's right by my house.

i have been multiple times. always painfully slow! each time i've been it's at least 20 minute wait! one time i was sick between people and sat there for 45 minutes! the food quality is not to cfa standards as well, cold, miniature sized pieces of chicken don't even cover half of the sandwich, wrong items, even my milkshake was a liquid mess. 

the worst part besides how slow is the service of the employees, they are all rude, never smile or say my please or any of the normal cfa service. they honestly do not care that you wait for 30 minutes they go about talking and joking and just standing around? there's a line completely all the way around the building and your moving like a slug. it's not a welcoming environment it's like they all hate their job! the employees even argue and yell at each other on multiple occasions in the dining area and the drive thru.

you have one... i repeat 1 star on yelp tom ellington! do you not think it is time to hire new management!!! 

also i can't believe chick-fil-a as a corporation is allowing this nonsense to go on. this is horrible for the chick-fil-a name to have such an establishment!",1
"came here for a french winterlicous lunch and was content with my meal.  nothing really stood out that impressed me and everything i tasted was average.  restaurant was busy with a few people waiting in line for a table.  i had reservations for 6 people.  didn't get a table until after 10 minutes of waiting. decor seemed like a house converted into a restaurant.  wasn't much space to walk around to get to our table. washroom was more like a fast food washroom.

was able to try many of the dishes.  
the complimentary bread had hard & crunchy crust yet was soft & fluffy in the middle. bread would break apart when spreading butter on it. bread was great with finishing off sauce left on our plates. they were nice to give us extra bread when we asked for it.

rabbit & pistachio terrine with fig & tomato chutney, crostini.  was full of good flavours where the herbs and spices overpowered the taste of the rabbit.  if i was told it was chicken or pork i would have believed it.  

escargot & fusilli with morel mushroom & brandy cream sauce.  size of dish was small with few pieces of escargot.  the fusilli was firm and chewy which i didn't like.  the sauce and flavours of the whole dish were ok.

beef bourguignon with yukon gold mash, market vegetables, red wine & herb sauce.  tasted pretty much like beef stew with no soup.  wish the beef had more gelatin or fat within the meat.  vegetables, mash potatoes and sauce were all good.

duck confit & cassoulet beans crispy duck leg, braised navy beans, toulouse sausage, bacon.  the duck was too salty for me.  i did like the tenderness of the duck and flavour of the duck.  the sausage and bacon tasted like they were boiled in water for too long.

pecan tart with vanilla ice cream.  was a little sweeter than i liked.  other than that the flavours were good.  had a variety of textures which i liked.  

i'd recommend going with rabbit & pistachio terrine, beef bourguignon and pecan tart.",3
"i'm not even sure where to start this but here goes. i went in to see dr. woods back in 2014 for a couple of stops. well it turned out that both needed to be removed and had some that were pre-cancerous that just need to be sprayed. got lucky that he got all of it both times but still hurt during the healing for a couple of days. the lesson to learn is wear and spf50 or greater sun block and even a hat would be good. carlie fox is whom i visit for for when i think i might have something and don't want to wait to get in, she has worked her schedule to help out.

i have several pictures from a couple of treatments i would be willing to show so that you get things check early and wear sunblock and a hat when out doors.",5
"this was the worst ultrasound experience i have had in my life. the woman technician doing it was very rude, cold, did not smile even once; i felt like crying..wanted to walk out...so much negative energy!! we needed the ultrasound and its results fast due to placenta previa but i wish i went back to my other ultrasound technician. i believe when you are pregnant you especially need the happy, positive people around. i will never go back there and make sure i warn all the pregnant mamas out there to stay away. this is unacceptable.",1
"so this is the only place in the great cleveland (that i know of) that offers authentic burmese dishes. there are many options on the menu so it may be a bit daunting when choosing your meal. for starters, i recommend the pea fritters, which remind me a bit of indian samosas. the tea leaf salad has nice lemony dressing mixed with peanuts and pickled tea leaves. sounds like an odd combination but it seriously goes well together. the tom yum soup is like no other i've had in cleveland-just the right amount of kick and flavor. it paired perfectly with my grilled pork chop which was nicely seasoned and incredibly tender. also i recommend the chicken and ginseng noodles which has nice clean broth containing peppery homemade meatballs. all in all, i would definitely come back!",5
really nice mediterranean food !! i love their lamb shanks and knaffe. the servers are really nice and so is the owner \/manager. he comes to every table to check if everything is good. the rice that they use is high quality basmati. very tasty. knaffe is worth dying for.,4
"so, i've worked at two yummy burger places (delux and fez), so i think i know a good burger when i'm presented with one.  two hippies is yummy, nothing fancy, nothing incredible, but what do you expect for $5? i got yummy seasoned fries (which were soggy, but the irony is i love soggy french fries!), and the burger had yummy carmelized onions, which is delux's secret!

the best surprise was the owner, his customer service was incredibly great! best i've had in a long time. super nice guy, and even gave my fiance a free soda! gotta luv that dark cherry pop!

go, it's cute and fun!!",5
"i've always left happy and satisfied. i wish it were a little larger, because the tables are pretty tight. the staff is great, the food is very tasty, and there is a nice range of options on the menu. i like the k-pop music videos playing in the background, adds nicely to the ambiance. it's chill, it's youthful, it's fast service, great!",4
fun atmosphere.  i've gone a couple of times -- once for a business meeting and once for pleasure.  ordered breakfast from larder.  had mimosas from the bar.  it's just a cool place to hang out.,5
"we recently moved into the isle and our experience here as been fantastic. the walkways and grounds are kept pristine, the staff is always quick to respond to any questions we have, and if you submit any maintenance request it will be fixed the next day. the apartments are well priced for the area. to get the best price you will need to keep an eye on the prices of the apartments as they will change weekly based on demand. we got ours for 795\/month and a month later the same apartment was up to 990\/month. overall, great apartments and great service!",5

at the public computers there is a woman literally singing out loud.  no librarian to be seen.

"at the nexus between busy 422, the heart of solon's industrial area, and several hotels catering to business travellers, this place makes buku cash hand over fist from morning to night.  so it doesn't worry about food quality, getting your order right, or good customer service.  

biggest complaint would have to be the wait.  during the weekday lunch rush (noon - 1 pm), you may spend 15 sometimes 20 minutes waiting in the drive-thru line.  walking in isn't much better either.  it's simply a matter of capacity - they aren't set up for quicker production and therefore people sit or stand in line for an inordinate amount of time.

next complaint would be their terrible customer service.  sometimes you wait at the drive-thru order kiosk for 5 minutes before someone takes your order even though there's nobody ahead and seemingly no one in the store.  i've watched po'd drivers just drive off in frustration.  other times they get your food order wrong.  twice i've driven away with something completely not what i ordered.  (someone else's maybe?)  and you almost always get a crappy attitude at the window and counter.

i swear this place must be on a probation officer's kickback list...

unfortunately it's the only fast food place open late with a drive-thru in the immediate solon industrial area.",2
purchased for my boyfriend's birthday. easy online booking! you can upgrade the package upon arrival as well. he wanted more laps and i'm glad he did. i chose 4 laps which we found out you're just getting warmed up. all staff was very nice and knowledgeable. he loved the experience! he can't wait to go back! next time i would recommend early times. we were in the late afternoon the sun was beaming and hard for him to see at certain points on the racetrack.,5
"the food was pretty good. nothing great but definitely not bad. very basic menu with a lot of variety, which i like when i don't know what i want or when with a group. 

i dined here twice on my trip in vegas. 

the first was right around midnight, my bf and i ordered to-go meals to take to the room. the girl was nice and after taking our order, offered for us to sit in a corner booth to wait for our food since it would take 10 minutes or so. we took our seat and waited. and waited. and waited. a good 25-30 minutes later, we realized we hadn't gotten our food, and not one person came up to us to let us know our food was ready or not. so i got up to ask the girl what was going on, she had our food sitting on the back counter. she asked my name and gave me the bag. once in the room, the food was pretty lukewarm. not a huge deal, but i just wish she would have kept a better read of the situation. we were maybe 5 steps from where she was, right around the corner. aw well. food was fine.

the second time was the morning we were leaving, grabbing breakfast before hitting the road. the server was nice, took our order since we were ready quickly. food and drinks came out semi quick and were all delivered by different people. when our food was dropped off, i asked for more ketchup since ours was empty. he said, ""okay"" in a somewhat confused voice and never returned. a server never really came back until we flagged someone down that we were ready for the check, after sitting there with empty plates for a few minutes. now, i have worked as a server in the past, so i get it when you're busy, but there is still a way to keep up with your tables or have someone else do it. the real problem is that the restaurant was not super busy. maybe 3\/4 full and i saw at least 10-12 employees buzzing around so didn't seem under staffed. 

eat here if you don't care about customer service or if you're not in a rush. the food is decent and they have a lot to chose from. at least when you do get to interact with the employees, most of them are quite nice.",3
"when in phoenix you must go to this theatre! located in the scottsdale quarter, it's the perfect location for a theatre of this kind. you can purchase your tickets before hand or there and though it's a little more expensive, the experience is worth the extra couple of dollars! there is a full bar inside along with food - i'm talking about real food not just your typical nachos and hot dogs that are available at theaters. 
the seats in this theatre are amazing! you can pay a little extra and sit in the upper portion of the theatre in the cute orange seats that are so relaxing. in these seats you get your own server who comes and asks if you need any more drinks or food- great service! btw the sweet potato fries are the best i've ever had, who would have ever known! after relaxing in the theatre( feels like you're at home in your own private theatre) you can walk around and enjoy the tons of cute shops and of course great restaurants that surround the theatre!",5
"was looking for a new place to get some korean food and came across this place. came here on a monday on boxing day and decided on this place. from the outside, it just looks to be a place at the end of a plaza, but upon waking in you are presented with an entirely different atmosphere. for seating, it looks like there are two available options. there is the traditional sit down where you sit cross-legged at a table raised from the floor, have your shoes down on the floor. or they have regular table seating which is what i opted for. 

the wait time wasn't too bad. took about 10-15 minutes with no reservation, but it looks like the place is pretty popular and usually takes reservations. got sat down by our waiter and quickly got our korean side dishes. for starters we got kimchi, turnip, bean sprouts, and also bean curd. we got our order quite quickly after ordered shortly after getting our appetizers and had hot tea offered at the get go. 

ordered some tteokbokki, gamjatang, spicy seafood soup, dolsot bibimbap, and jajangmyeon.

tteokbokki:
starting with the rice cakes they were cooked well to the perfect consistency and had a good sourish tomato based sauce to go with it. the rice cakes also had a hard boiled egg and some bean curd which went well with the sauce. 

gamjatang:
the pork bone soup bowl consisted mainly of a couple of pieces of pork bone that took up most of the sizzling bowl. i thought that having the pork bone made the broth provide a good burst of flavor as every sip was taken. the bean sprouts and green onion with the soup provided a little bit of a crunch to the taste. had an excellent addition to brown rice ordered that was ordered.

spicy seafood soup:
the seafood soup came in a sizzling presentation looked really good. from other places where i have gotten seafood soup, i felt that it could have had a bit more to offer when it came to seafood. there was a mussel or two, a few bay shrimp, and a few pieces of squid. the soup had the flavor enriched by the seafood but needed the rice to make it a fulfilling dish.

dolsot bibimbap:
the bibimbap came in really hot and had a little bit of beef on the side. the dish had a nice egg on the top to dispersed throughout the dish with mushrooms, carrots, cucumber, shredded seaweed, and shredded lettuce. very much a balanced bowl and would be a great recipe to get as an all in one entree.

jajangmyeon:
the black bean noodles came in with the noodles, sauce, and cucumber. quite a potent dish and maybe a little too potent in black bean sauce. they were quite good, but the dish tasted like it had a little bit too much salt.

overall from my experience from the place the service was excellent, meals were adequate. the only thing was the price was a little bit steep for the meat. most of the meat dishes ranged from $20-$60. do i recommend this place? yes to try at least once and get a pretty traditional experience, but the price is a little higher than other korean restaurants. i would rate this place a 4 out of 5 due to the price.",4
service was really bad. i don't think i have ever been to a bar where i have had an empty glass in front of me for 15 minutes on 2 separate occasions. the bartenders were more interested in other things instead of waiting on their customers. we couldn't even get their attention to order more drinks. nice beer selection with all the local breweries. pretzel bites were good but burger & barbecue sandwich were dry & below average.,2
"good place to drink. good place to eat. they have lots of good beer and excellent nightly food specials. the service is good and the place feels neighborhood-y, which i like. sometimes they have live music and djs which bring in fun crowds. they also have fun trivia every other sunday.",5
"there's nothing exciting at this zaxby's except maybe it's location adjacent to an outlet mall. 

inside is rather plain and boring. service is slowwwwwwwww here and the food isn't that great compared to other area zaxby's. my chicken was overcooked and it was cold because it sat there too long because the place was understaffed during a lunch hour.",2
"great  service , the owner is really nice especially if you speak hindi. the waiters are very attentive when it comes to filling drinks, taking plates and making sure that you are satisfied. we came in around 9pm and the buffet was still full and worth it ( $10 per person) . my girlfriend is a vegetarian and she enjoyed the sahi paneer and i'm non-veg and i loved the tandoori chicken and chicken masala. if you guys enjoy beer than i would recommend hayward 5000 to add delightful yet unique favor. p. s. the bathrooms are clean, and check groupon out if your looking for dinner for 2.",5

"just started coming here since my hair girl moved over to this salon.  i love the location, parking is usually pretty easy and after a long day of sitting in the chair there's plenty of food options around. 

i come here to see my girl trena who has been doing my hair for the past 2 years now?  she knows my style and what will or will not work with my hair type.  this last visit i decided to go from blonde ombré to red\/violet and i love the color!  after getting washed, dried and style i felt like a million bucks! 

(final outcome picture attached) 
some other things i like about this salon is that i feel there's a little more privacy from booth to booth, sometimes when in deep conversation during a session i may not want the whole salon to hear what's been going on ok my life.  

salon has water cooler and coffee and my last 2 visits have had a small snack.  brownies and hair did... score!",5
best gastro pub in the area in my opinion. not a slight either. it's beside the gas station and is a nice atmosphere for watching the game or grabbing a pint. try and get a booth,4

everything i've had from the ahi, salmon, taegu, mussels, or imitation crab is fresh and full of flavor! they even have section to buy hawaiian brand products and groceries.

"ahhhhhhhh idk. 

i've stayed here like a bajillion times. my mom loves this hotel. its a love\/hate thing for me. it's the opportunity cost of having a great location for the cheapest price but how much cleanliness and quality are you willing to sacrifice??? personally, this last visit did me in. hairs all over the shower...really? also there were tootsie roll wrappers under the bed... which is funny bc last time i stayed here i also found tootsie roll wrappers under the bed... i think paris has tootsie roll parties in their rooms or something bc tootsie roll wrappers are all over the place lolol.. 
i'm not happy about the quality of cleanliness or standard of presentation. with that being said, i've never ran into an employee that was anything less than curtious, kind, and hospitable. but the overall ""tone"" of the hotel has some overhauling. 
they're in the process of revamping all their rooms- which is great bc this place was getting dated. 
i love that the pool is huge and chill. a get away to nurse your hangover. also, they allow dogs which is clutch and why they get 2-stars.

either way, there's a 60% chance i'll be back.",2
"we've been coming here for decades. the food never disappoints and price is reasonable. the folks here are usually very friendly and hospitable. but the speed of the service is something they have to get a handle on. on our recent visit, it took over 20 minutes to order and over 30 minutes to get our food. it was 3pm on a sunday afternoon and the line was not unusually long either. it was painfully slow and it didn't make for a great dining experience. this may be sacrilegious to say, especially to the regulars (and there are many), but they need to get off of hawaiian time or hire more people. i'll keep coming back, but this is not how i'd run a business.",3
eric fixed my wife's iphone glass in less than 5 minutes and at a reasonable price too!  highly recommend him!,5
"love the atmosphere! 
plenty of big screens!

i ordered buffalo chicken with jalapeño wrap, it was good...fish came on a hamburger bun, it was good (not super huge) about 12 oz 

best thing about the npl was the atmosphere, food is decent, look forward to going and trying some other things",3
this place is for purists!  be prepared for a great deal of questionable textured items if you order the tasting...great sushi and sashimi however i would go to sakana sushi & grill for a true sashimi \/ sushi experience.,4
"the restaurant is really cool, it's a old house converted into a restaurant. the area inside is small but sufficient. we didn't know sunday lunch time was only buffet, we saw the dosa pics and went in for dosa and had the buffet. luckily plain dosa is included in the buffet. for 10 dollar there isn't much to complain. the food was good but the options weren't traditional, they didn't have a single paneer dish on the buffet that day. taste wise i would give the food a 6.5\/10. service for the dosa could have been quicker. the naan was too chewy but a decent place to grab a meal.",3
"i am so glad we got shutterbooth for our wedding reception. they were quick to respond to emails, gave great options for customization of the booth, and the day of photobooth attendant was great. maybe most importantly the photos are very good quality! and i loved the guestbook where guests put their photostrips and signed, it was an awesome momento of our wedding. highly recommended!!",5
"although i walked in to the hospital a bit skeptical of the automated check- in process, and being told there was only a male physician available to see me, my experience turned around as soon as i was taken in for treatment. the most understanding, compassionate and professional nurse i've ever met, ruby, began treating me and put my mind at ease. the male physician came in and said he would find a female physician in another part of the hospital. enter dr. miller! her demeanor and understanding were off the charts. she diagnosed and treated me within minutes. by the time i got off of the hospital bed i was feeling 10x's better. from the time i left for the hospital from our hotel on the strip, to the hospital, pharmacy and returned to the hotel it was two hours! unheard of. i've spent more time than that in an er waiting room. for such an unpleasant situation to find yourself in, this went better than i could have imagined. thank you nurse ruby and doctor miller!",5
"we have been here a couple of times. the prices are ok, just average to other places around town.  the happy hour menu doesn't offer anything to our taste and the prices are high for the quantity of food we have seen on the plates that pass by our table. the reason for the lower rating is that the front windows face the west and therefore you are watching the sunset.  the windows are filthy!!!!! it looks as if they haven't been washed since the first day the place opened......are you kidding?  are they cheap to find a window washer? it makes you wonder how clean the rest of the restaurant is.  actually my husband was served a glass of wine the other night that still had lipstick on it  :( most bartenders watch for this and clean the glasses before putting them away!",3
"i have purchased cupcakes at urban cookies several times.  i find it to be convenient and their cupcakes are quite delightful.  the problem that i have is with the staff.  they never give you a pleasant greeting.  no matter what time of day i walk in there, they behave as though it is a bother to provide service.  this last time i walked in the first words out of the gentleman's mouth was ""how many cupcakes do you want""?  no greeting!  i answered then pondered over the selection.....he stood there with a bored look on his face and advised me as to how many more i needed and said so quite impatiently.  i was with my 12 year old granddaughter who stated when we walked out of there, ""wow, he was so grouchy"".  this is the last time i will go to urban cookies, quite unfortunate but, if they keep up with their lack of customer service, their doors will not stay open.  there are lots of cupcake shops popping up in the valley and the drive will be worth it just to walk out with a pleasant feeling.",2
"once upon a time, long, long ago this used to be the phoenix.  see my review right before this one.

now it's the root cafe.  when i came by on my visit to lakewood, anticipating my nirvana (the mocha made with toddy, see previous review) i was not happy to see the root had taken hold and the phoenix was gone.

after going in and talking to the nice folks, i found that they have a strong lineage to the phoenix and continue to make great toddy.  *relief*

once i saw what a great space they have, the nice community feel, the friendly service and the same great toddy...i approve! @therootcafe",5
i went to their booth at the tuscon reptile show. they have the best crested geckos there. they also gave me some helpful tips on how to care for them. i got a baby one that is really healthy. this is the best reptile store ever!,5
"my friend and i were driving back to boston from chicago. after a few long hours on the road, we stopped here for a late dinner.

the place was fun. everything from the model train chugging around tracks suspended from the ceiling to the 70's soul band playing to a very enthusiastic (and inebriated) crowd made this one hell of a stop. 

our steaks were great for the price. and for 7 bucks, i got a sampler of the house beers. as a warning, their ""samplers"" are filled to the top, and one tray does not count as a beer. (needless to say, i didn't drive the rest of that night).

if you're in the area, and don't want to stop in the city, this is a nice relaxing place to stop (based on my one time here). i'd say i'd go back... but its not worth the 7 hour drive. though, i may just have been overly amused by the band and the trains...",4
"first time going there today and i think this is some of the best yellow curry i've had all year! it is absolutely delicious and flavorful. i asked for a level 2 and got a level 2 which is important to me. the service was okay. not bad not great but i will definitely be going back. because i called in my order and carried out, i can't speak to the service as a sit down customer. i also think the decor is dark, i wish it was more light and airy, but not a deal breaker. overall, the food is amazing and i think i may have found my local thai restaurant.",4
"as a local southsider, i'm giving nadine's five stars for being exactly what it intends to be: a local spot serving up good, solid pub food in a very friendly neighborhood environment. 
     living right around the corner, i can't imagine a better spot to chow down on a traditional american breakfast. if you want carving stations and mix-your-own bloody mary bars, go elsewhere...but if you crave a real eggs, toast, sides & good coffee spot, accompanied by a real southside atmosphere, walk right in and grab a seat at the bar. 
     i set the bar high for breakfast, knowing that while it seems so basic and effortless, it's also often a disappointment when eating out. not so at nadine's. stopping in recently, during the polar freeze, i had one of the best ""regular"" american breakfasts that i've had in ages. sunny side eggs done perfectly! not an easy task, thanks matt! paired with perfect toast and a luscious slice of ham...i was happy! my friend's over medium eggs were, again, prepared just right, with a side of what she proclaimed to be ""the best bacon "" she's ever eaten. your basic american breakfast..but done so well..a treat indeed! couple that with the friendly conversation at the bar, and if you're really lucky, a visit with the charming miss nadine herself and it's about as perfect a pittsburgh neighborhood experience as you're likely to find.
     if breakfast isn't your thing, don't hesitate to try any of the daily specials being offered...from homemade soups, sandwiches from the grill, and strong favorites like a killer hot roast beef or spaghetti and meatballs, you won't be disappointed. portions are generous, the prices are right, and you can settle into a conversation about the steelers or buccos before you've even settled in your seat...a real gem on the southside.",5
great pulled pork spot. good value with a combo for £6. though bagged chips and bottled drinks were nothing special. not much seating so you may need to takeaway if busy.,4
"well, it seems to be tough for me to find a really good garlic knot, and for some reason, thats important to me when grading a new york style pizza place.
i ordered on the phone near closing time. the pizza was ready in about 20 minutes, so that was fine with me. another important element...... they got my order correct. i split the halves of the pizza, so i love when they dont foul things up. the workers were nice and friendly at closing time, so i bet they are even better when they are not itching to go home. 
as for the food....... i have to say that the pizza was pretty good. worth a 4\/5 for that alone. i will have to try a few more in the charlotte area before i praise it too much, but it was good. the garlic knots though.............. i thought they were quite sub par. they were very tough and dough-y. these have a dipping oil type coating, which is good...... if i was using it to dip my bread in at a restaurant. i guess i am used to light textured knots with a garlic\/parmesan cheese coating, not flavored oil. but hey, i liked the pizza............... and its ""tony's pizza"" not ""tony's garlic knots"", right?!?!
i'll be back.",3
"we went here for a date night.  it was disappointing how crowded the tables were. when we are going to be spending a lot of money on dinner, we would expect to be a little farther away from other people. 
the bread they give you before your meal is a big onion roll.  it has dehydrated onion pieces browned on top. they serve it with a pretty piped ruffle of whipped butter.
the steak was nothing special. the portions are far to big for me so i did not order a steak. my boyfriend got the new york strip and i just had a few bites of his ( we didn't finish the steak between the two of us).  it was ok, i was hoping that it would be similar to mastro's since they are both part of landry's, it was not nearly as good though.  
i got the truffle mashed cauliflower and the bacon onion mac and cheese.  i was disappointed in the mac. ( for one the server told us they use powered onion in it- how gross and cheap of them.) it also just tasted like bar food. the sauce was gritty and very orange and not a lot of flavor. the bacon pieces were very crisp though, so that was good. 
the mashed truffle cauliflower was alright, other than the crusted parmesan pieces on top it didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  truffle is usually pretty overpowering.   it was good when mixed with all of the juices from the steak though. 
they had a classic dessert menu,  souffles, chocolate cake, cheese cake, berries and cream etc. 
i do not like chocolate or cheesecake though so we opted to go elsewhere for dessert. 
we probably will not go back here, it definitely was not worth the money or the drive. there are several other places that offer much better food and experience.",2
"being originally from germany myself, i was naturally curious about the atmosphere and the food. it did not disappoint. it's a smal place and space is limited, but the food is pretty good and authentic. although a little bit on the pricey side, i can definitely recommend to eat there. i'll give it 4.5 stars.",4
this was much smaller than i anticipated. there wasn't much room to dance which is one of my favorite things to do. drinks were expensive but i've learned to expect that from nightclubs. if i had had to pay for this experience i would have been much less happier than i was.,3
"not very tasteful...i expect tacos to be flavourful. i asked for the hot sauce but even that was nowhere close to being hot and spicy. i ordered the tacos dorados (chicken) which was marked as one of the popular dishes but didn't really enjoy it. it was not bad, but nothing special either. staff was friendly and they were clean and organized.",2
"personable and friendly staff, clean, always stocked! i love the walgreens itself, the photo, speedy pharmacy, and clinic! i go to walgreens for everything i love it!",5
"this is by far one of my favorite local hideaways.  it's just outside of las vegas but it feels like a whole different world.  the hotel has a moroccan theme to it and there are a ton of things to do here.  it's directly on lake las vegas and you can rent canoes, kayaks, paddle boats, etc and explore the beautiful lake with all the mansions along the water.  or you can take a boat or shuttle to the village across the water for dining or entertainment.  they put on jazz festivals in the village nearly all summer long..........now back to the hotel; they have multiple pools (adult & kids pools), water slides, basketball court, table tennis, putting green, full outdoor restaurant, indoor restaurant, lounge\/bar, and plenty of secluded places to relax all over this amazing hotel.  you really need to see this for yourself.  i heard they've recently switch over from lowes to westin but the hotel itself should remain very similar in style & amenities from what i've heard.  i look forward to going back there in the fall when the weather is perfect.  i frequent this hotel at least once a year, it's a great place to get away.",5
"it was a year 2001, the year i developed my love for baseball. when i started coming to watch their game, i didn't even know the rules, now i sometimes coach at a little league.

last week when i came to see a game, it was a clear reminder that this team offers more than just a game. i like the fact they contribute to a local community. i like to participate to 50\/50 raffles. i like to watch kids run bases after a game on sunday and donate to the phoenix children's hospital. i like when they make an announcement to men and women in the service. it just so nice to see how they are so close to a local community.",4
i had to write a review simply because of the poor ones i've seen. i'll be honest i never really watched the show (i'm a bsb gal ) but my friends and i were excited to try the food because we've heard great things. it was about a 45 min wait (to be expected on a sunday for lunch) and we were instantly greeted by a woman when we sat down. she was so unbelievably nice that we just found ourselves chit chatting with her! turns out she was the manager (can't think of her name...) who was taking our order. we just loved talking to her she was so nice and funny...a definite great hire!! the food was simply amazing we had the original burger and tots..best burger i think i've ever had. thank you for the amazing service and delicious food! - 4 chicagoians who came for the bsb but stayed for the wahlburgers :),5
"we recently went to yelp's ultimate pley date! and received a couple coupons to zoe's. i'm really glad we did! i tried this place when it first opened but haven't returned because i am not particularly a fan of greek food. so i was very pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it. =)

perry was behind the counter when we went in and she was so friendly and helpful! she helped with some recommendations. i ended up getting a grilled chicken pasta and my boyfriend got the chicken kabobs. both were very tasty.",4
"the bacon cheeseburger wrap is an idea whose time has come. the juicy burger, crispy bacon in a bed of lettuce, tomato, mustard, mayo and red onion was a piece of low-carb awesomeness. ingredients were fresh.

there's a bit of an outdoor sitting area right next to it. the person behind me ordered the teriyaki chicken wrap, maybe i'll get that next time...

good fast service and bang for buck.",4
"the store has a beautiful atmosphere, very serene. on my first visit i waited over half an hour past my appointment time. this was not ok because i had a formal evening event later that night. my hair, however was amazing and gorgeous. i forgave the waiting, got many compliments, and was not late.",4
"the place is quite decent, but it is kind if strange for me that a sushi house has chinese food and dumdum in the menu. 
so it actually gives me a strong feeling that it is not authentic .

second thing that quite disturb me is the music they played here is all mandarin songs. it may better to play plain music or japanese. 
many chinese operated sushi houses have the same problem here: play chinese songs in japanese restaurant. weird! 


for the sushi itself, it is ok. but the rice is still very warm when i eat them, and the fish is not cold enough. 

for the deep fried tofu, so-so, i don't like the smell of the oil, seems like it is not so fresh. 

for the beef onion roll, it tastes bad because it is not fresh, and a bit sour too.",2
"always great service when i come here. very friendly staff and great food. love the sandwiches, salads and shakes! shakes are half off if you order between 3-5pm every day!",5
"you can read the other 2500 reviews, or take in these highlights:

- location is fun and casual. 
- relatively speaking, the prices are not terrible for casual fare.
- big portions.
- frozen hot chocolate is nice, but not worth the premium.

i sampled the chicken strips, buffalo style.  not bad, fried goopy deliciousness.  cole slaw was ok.  dining on the back patio was quiet, nice on a warm night.",4
"today my hubby and i went to a chinese seafood buffet place because i was craving all you can eat crab legs. i was expecting lots of seafood but their selection was kind of meh. i did find chicken feet, pigs feet, frog legs, and whole baby octopi however. so i decided (bravely) to try them. 

first of all, i have no idea how you are supposed to eat chicken feet. it is, well, it's a freaking chicken foot. it's all bones with a little bit of skin on it. just the way it looked was enough to make me gag. but i figured, i would probably not have this opportunity again. so i picked it up and was like, am i supposed to just bite into it? i decided not to and instead tried picking the ""meat"" off the bone. it was so tough - like rubber. i managed to get this eraser sized piece off and put it in my mouth. blech! it was seasoned in some kind of chili sauce and was so tough, i couldn't even chew it. so i immediately spit it out. 

then i moved onto the pigs foot. it looked like a little short rib and thankfully it didn't have the hoof still attached. but it was pure fat. i looked for any hint of meat, but there was none. so i bit into it (because you can). blech! it's freaking like blubbery jelly. i almost lost it right then and there. the taste was like pork, but the texture grossed me out. 

i needed a minute to recover from that. but then i moved onto the frog leg. i picked a piece of meat off the bone. it's true what they say, that it tastes like chicken. the texture is like chicken too. it was almost like eating a chicken wing due to the size. it wasn't bad. but after i ate that little piece, i saw a long blue vein running through the rest of it. then i saw more blue things inside. just the visual was enough to put it down. too bad because it tasted okay. 

i actually like octopus, but i've never had a whole one before. i was a little scared, but i started with the legs. it was good! so i quickly shoved the rest in my mouth and it was fine. nothing squirted out, which i was afraid of. it was just chewy all around and tasted okay. 

so did i ever get to try any crab? well, when they finally brought it out i grabbed a few pieces and thought finally! but when i opened the claw, there was no meat! wtf? what the hell kind of crab is this (it wasn't snow crab)? so i cracked open a leg. again, very little meat and what was there, was dry and tasted extremely fishy. i got scared and didn't eat anymore. 

so there was my adventure into the scary world of chinese seafood buffets. at least i got to cleanse my pallet with dry chocolate cake and some really good kahlua and cream like jello shot. that was the best thing i had all day!",2
"i walked in at around 12:00 pm on a friday. there were three employees behind the counter, including the cashier who was ringing up an order. other than the person paying, there was no one in line.

the remaining two employees were a woman mixing potatoes with seasoning and a man speaking with her.

upon entering and lining up, i was not greeted. the potato mixer looked up, saw me and looked back down. the man speaking to her (about potatoes, perhaps) looked in my general direction and turned back toward her. they continued their conversation, without acknowledging me. 

this continued for roughly two minutes. at this point, i said (out loud) ""ok"" and proceeded to walk away. no one made any attempt to turn me back.

i have worked with the public and understand that prep work is an essential part of running a restaurant. however, prioritizing it over a waiting customer, without so much as a greeting, is a surefire way to lose customers.

i'll never trouble them again.",1
"i came here for an alternative to thanksgiving. for a weekend, it was pretty quiet but at the same time, it was a very cozy place. 
the atmosphere has the feel of a restaurant but the playfulness of a bar. it makes for a good relaxing environment and i'm sure that if i was here during a game, it would be a little more livened up. either way, i was very comfy here.
considering that this is a tapas bar, don't think that the even though the portions look small, you need to order a lot. the portions are very filling. if you like a dish, you may not be able to grab sections cause you've tried a bunch of others indefinitely. i thought a lot of these dishes weren't going to fill me up but i was wrong. pace yourself
something to help you pace is that they serve you tea. it warmed me up and it was good to have. drinking water, you'll fill yourself up with it because the servers are really good at refilling it. tea will relax you plus, their green tea is amazing so why not?

try:
yam fries - sweet potatoes fries with a house dressing kick. they're good to start off with it you're still unsure on what to try. the dressing has a little spicy kick to it but paired with that tea, it doesn't overpower your palette.
lobster fantasy - i have nothing but good things to say for this. deep fried lobster tail with cucumber and avocado topped with lobster salad. pardon the pun but this was a fantasy for my mouth. i wanted seconds but i'm pretty sure i was getting full already. you cannot come here and not try this.
apple salmon roll - salmon sashimi with apple mayo dressing. the problem with this was that it came right after the lobster fantasy. it was a good dish but it couldn't live up to the hype my taste buds were having already. it had a sweet taste to it and the apple mayo emphasized it. if you are going to order this, order it before the lobster fantasy so you can appreciate it more. i wish i had done that.
buttered scallops and shrimps - baked scallop and shrimp in garlic butter. as a shellfish fan, i gobbled this down like i've never eaten food before. the butter is not overwhelming on the plate so you can taste and enjoy the scallops and the shrimps. it was a softer touch to the food but that was because they weren't grilled and it works! huge contrast with the sushi because of the deep fried portion. loved it!

the dishes are rather creative which adds to the feel of the place.
i really enjoyed being here. it was a quaint little location and it hid in the bustle of the street but it's a gem. a diamond in the rough. i felt pretty at home here. 
i would definitely want to come back, bring friends, drink some sake, watch a game. i think the next on my list would be to try the oysters and the java burgers.",4
"my go to place for special occasions, and celebrations. amazing food and amazing service. the special is always outstanding. the sweet potato ravioli lives up to it's reputation. my favorite restaurant in charlotte.",5
"avoid this service shop. took a tape player on for cleaning and service, the cleaned it mostly, changed 1 of the two belts that both needed replaced, then refused on multiple occasions to align the machine, no, i'm not kidding, the tech said he doesn't like to adjust things, so i spent hundreds on a machine that i had to do a full calibration when i got it back. their service is very bad, they will have your equipment for quite a while (3monthes for me), and it won't work when u get it back. i got very bad feedback about them after the fact from all the hifi stores in the area. their techs also seem very untrained.  there are other repair stores in phoenix, use one of them.",1
"bf took me here for my birthday on a saturday night. we had reservations and requested fountain seating. wait was about five minutes and our table ready for us:) i ordered my favorite, and the restaurant's signature dish linguine frutti de mare. waiter was very nice and the dish was amazing. a bit pricey, but i highly recommend this dish and restaurant:)",5
"i am fortunate as i live next door. i love the outside patio on a beautiful evening.  the happy hour is outrageous!  the bartenders and waiters are friendly and knowledgeable. the food is phenomenal and the prices are so low.  i love that this place is my neighborhood bar.  in my opinion, if you are looking for old school style and sophistication, this is the place for you.",4
"i'm persian myself, their food is always cold... and i'm sure they preheat that before giving to customer! 
i dont recommend this restaurant!",1
date night and we decided to try a new restaurant. i was immediately pleased when we stepped they the door and the ambiance was exactly what i needed. i ordered the parmesan chicken and my husband ordered the filet with mashed potato. my fish was excellent. everything was just right. we will definitely come again.,5
"if you're familiar with my reviews and my shopping habits, then you know how much i love anthropologie. not surprising, this is the third location i will have reviewed to date... i felt compelled to do so because if you haven't visited this location and like me, have experienced the lackluster meh-ness that is our current economy, this is a great spot to find a deal or two that won't break the bank. 

like most anthro locations, there is a sales ""closet"" ripe with markdowns; many items which were new to the racks less than a full season before. 

this anthro's sales closet resembles my closet at home, in the sense that it spills over and out...and there are many more racks to explore. 

as always, anthropologie has many lush options to pursue, fondle, and when the price is right - purchase. the sales closet at the foum shops is the best i've experienced.

this location also has the largest selection of handbags and jewelry that i've come across... and furniture. i'm fond of keith johnson and man shops globe so i love visiting an anthro that has one of a kind finds in the way of housewares.... now, if only i could hit a winning slot or table....  

in all their bright (and muted) colors... in book form, house wares and fabrics that yearn to be touched... (fondled)... it would certainly be easy to transfer a paycheck (or two) directly over... but it is the boutique charm and the reminder that quality over quantity that pokes at a deeper 'before consumerist' memory within me that has me leaving with no more than one amazing piece at a time (and perhaps a book or two).",5
"grabbed breakfast food here.  hash browns were burnt.  scrambled eggs were a bit runny and bacon wasn't as crispy.  mainly didn't like the service at the very end.  we had a flight to catch and needed to leave.  another server printed out the check for us, and we paid our bill and left it at the table.  the server runs towards us and tells us we don't pay at the front and we have to pay her.  we pointed to the bill with all the cash and said it's there.  when she finally grabs the bill and sees the cash, her tone flips back to being nice.

no, i don't like it when a server thinks we want a free meal.",2
"good mediterranean food, gyro, hummus, fries all tasty.  greek salad was nice as well.  ask them to brown the meat a little more mine was cooked but not crispy enough.",4
"amazing food, and even better service!

we had reservations for a monday, and it turns out a reservation was definitely a good idea because i didn't see any new people get seated probably until after 8. we ordered a dozen oysters (buck-a-shuck mondays), blood sausage & egg salad sandwiches, octopus skewers, mussels in a tomato sauce, and scallops in a pesto sauce. everything was delicious! i think because it was buck-a-shuck, the kitchen seemed pretty slow. we ended up staying at the restaurant for 2.5 hours. for a while, it didn't seem as if anyone's food was coming. however, the waitress came by twice and gave us some molasses bread as well as smoked mackerel on an oat bar, all on the house, as an apology for the wait. i thought that was amazing! i didn't expect her to give us 2 appetizers while we were waiting. my favourite was definitely the octopus skewers.

the service made the wait bearable. the atmosphere is lovely, and we were able to get a seat right by the window. would recommend to everyone!",5
advertising cheddar bacon bites but out.  won't make new ones unless i pay for it first and wait 8 minutes.  what?!?!!,1
"je suis sortie jusqu'à tard, après des mois et des mois! rendu chez une amie vers 3h du matin et sur guy et st-antoine, nous commencions à avoir faim. et à part une pizzeria louche de verdun, il n'y avait pas de resto ouvert pour la livraison. il fallait donc se déplacer pour manger. désolé je ne suis pas assez riche pour foodora ou ubereat... et du mcdo..et bien, j'en ai mangé 3 fois en 2 semaines..  anyways

 c'est alors que yelp m'a aidé à trouver un resto à proximité et ouvert....le boustan était le choix judicieux! nous nous sommes donc aventurer sur la rue des très jeunes  soupçons des sorties de clubs, qui chill encore à 3h40, car c'est sûrement leur première sortie avec fake id, je parle de la rue crescent! arrivé devant le fameux boustan, il y en avait des petits jeunes souls avec leur spinner..et un line -up. malgré le line-up, ça n'a pas pris de temps pour se faire servir! j'ai pris un classique
..le trio sandwich poulet, avec patates! 

malgré mon ancienne vie de débauche, qui incluait des fois la rue crescent, je n'avais jamais essayé le boustan de crescent. j'avais été à celui de rivière-des-prairies, qui était ok..mais sans plus...tsé tout est bon en y ajoutant de l'ail ou presque...! il y avait du monde qui me parlait du boustan...que c'était donc ben bon et tout...mais bon je ne les comprenais pas...car à rdp comme je vous dit c'était ordinaire...

bref, sur mes patates j'ai demandé humus et sauce à l'ail. j'adore quand le gars derrière le comptoir prend la cuillère remplie de sauce et y va d'un élan pour que la sauce tombe adéquatement sur les patates! quand j'ai goûter au sandwich..j'ai compris pourquoi les gens capotait autant!! le sandwich est tout chaud tout croustillant! le poulet est malade mental  et les patates wow! bref, c'est sûre que je recommande le boustan peut importe l'heure! j'ai bien hâte d'y retourner miam!",5
"love it!  just had it the other day and it was great.  small place that was very clean and very affordable.  i got a coupon out of the mail for a buy one get one free, and let me tell all of you that it was more than enough food.  he also runs specials for $1 tacos.",5

"the food here is really, really good and flavorful and the price point is great for the quality of the food! i've only tried the braised pork bowl here and it was a delicious dish. my friend tried the brown butter miso and loved her food as well. i've also grabbed a galaxy lemonade here and wow they are so so so pretty and refreshing, perfect for a warm day outside!",4
"really good but prohibitively expensive. it should not cost $30 for a couple of smoothies and a bowl of soup, but it does.

strange hours and location in a shady part of town only add to the apparent lack of business acumen on part of the owner(s). and it's never cool when an employee has to personally go unlock a restroom door for you. 

put the same shop in a high-traffic, low crime area, reduce the prices to a more palatable level, and this place would really rock it!

update: going out of business! told ya so.",3
decided to try this place out today because my coworker recommended it. i left very satisfied with my full set and pedicure. i was seated quickly and was offered water before she started on my pedicure. the staff was super friendly. i'll definitely be coming back again.,4
"susan is such a great help with our 6 month old puppy! she is always available when we need her and she is very thorough regarding information she needs to care for him! she takes great pride in her business and is very professional! her services came at the perfect time after we adopted a dog and our little guy loves her! we are assured we are leaving our pup in wonderful hands and that she treats him like her own! we couldn't ask for a better person to take care of such a special part of our lives. everything about susan screams trustworthy, sweet, professional and wonderful person! she does provide many other services and i would highly recommend her so check out her website!",5
i've been craving boba and this hit the spot for me. i got my favorite strawberry almond milk with boba,4
they have the best bagels in this area!!!  i used to live super close and now live in phoenix but i still make the drive because the bagels are that good!  so much better than any chain bagel place!,5
"i love this place.  i buy almost all my computers and electronics there.  the people are great, and that's a good thing when it comes to electronics.  not everything works as advertised and they're great with an exchange or a repair.  i once bought a computer that turned out not to be powerful enough for what i needed.  they took it right back and got me one i needed.  no worries.  no problems.

i buy a lot of little things there too like headphones and external hard drives.  they always have a ton of selection.  the staff are very knowledgable and helpful, but it can take a while to get to one of them.  this place is bbbbiiiizzzzzyyyy.

i've always had a great selection there, especially with ink cartridges.  i have a printer that takes ink a lot of places don't carry.  i usually buy it online, but when i run out unexpectedly, fry's always has at least one in stock i can count on.

good place.",5
"wow, that was really good.   started in redthai for happy hour.  i highly recommend it and not just the martinis but the starters as well.  than, we moved from the bars to eat shabu shabu.  super good. we ate traditional and lemongrass broths with shabu beef, shrimp with spinach,  mushroom,  clear noodle and rice.",5
"over priced, covered in grease, undercooked & soft, i knew better when i got the cheese burger after only 2-3 minutes of cooking but still ate 1\/2 since i was so hungry and paid $8 for a greasy fast food burger. with in an hour my stomach hurt & i was sick for the next 24 hours. tums, pepto & water couldnt help fix this terrible burger experience. dont waste your money or your day by eating here.",1
"2 hrs to check in; the kiosk doesn't work....
finally i check in.... they charge me and extra 50 box fee for unknown ... when i ask, they said was for use the kiosk, that was not working...
next day, any of my two keys work... i have to go back to the registration and just to get another keys took about two hours again....
terrible experience. .. i do not recommend to visit this place....
the hotel in not too bad, buy service is the worst. ...
i still have to be here for two more days.....",1
very nice jerk chicken. absolutely love it. i have tried other places for jerk but this by far is the best of the best.,4
"this place should be a case study on how not to run a business. the sink they had me brush in had something growing in the bottom. the staff and the doctor have horrible bedside manner and it was clear to me that once they figured out they couldn't upsell me on their services they had no interest in me.  on my trip last week the hotels room service threw away my invisalign retainers and the whole point in choosing them was because they were supposed to be able to scan my teeth instead of taking impressions but there was no scanning, just a mouthful of goo as i held a paper towel over my shirt to catch any of her excess slop.  why would you have the patient hold something for you? get one of those employees to do your work for you or how about springing for a couple alligator clips and small chain like the rest of the dentist use?  go to a real orthodontist like where we took our son to robinson's where they are overly nice to you and don't just say 'she will take your $350 at the front desk.'  i feel sorry for the kids who have parents that would go to this place month after month.",1
"was liking for local to get a decent breakfast at 6 in the morning. my experience was a 7 out of 10. the place has a stuck in the 60's vibe about it, which rubbed me the wrong way. but the food makes up for that. i got exactly what i ordered and the way i ordered it. the food was out faster than most diners i've been too and that's a plus if you have places to go. all in all this place isn't a a bad place to get a bite to eat. just make sure you get a combo and don't add things cause four pieces of turkey bacon cost and extra 4.50. that's nuts.",4
"based in others' reviews waited until after the breakfast rush.  food and service were good. pancakes, hash browns, and coffee for under $10.",4
"wirklich nett, um entspannt im grünen zu sitzen und nett ein bier zu trinken oder ein eis zu essen. auch die maultaschen lassen sich durchaus essen.

an schönen tagen kann es eine weile dauern, bis man das essen an der ausgabe abholen kann.

insgesamt ist es eher die nette umgebung als das essen, was mich ins waldheim heslach zieht. es ist okay für einen imbiss, aber hat nicht die qualität, dass ich extra dafür ins waldheim fahren würde.

beobachten konnte ich, dass sich hier viele familien recht gut versorgt fühlen, wahrscheinlich vor allem wegen des spielplatzes.",3
"grand opening was yesterday!  made on demand pizzas is the concept here. same price for one topping or unlimited toppings. they make it up fresh in front of you and pop the za in their ovens for a quick baking. 

pizza not your thing??  well, mod does build-your-own salads, but customers can also order salads off a menu, like the pizzas. the restaurant sells garlic strips and cinnamon strips. there are shakes too if you have a sweet tooth. 

first time i have seen wine on tap and it tasted just fine!  couple of new glarus beers on tap, couple local bottles beers.  fountain or bottled sofas plus 2 teas and 2 lemonades. 

super friendly and smiley workers. i think they are going to do fine in this location",5
"nice place, awesome laser tag facility. good selection of games and the prize center had some nice prizes. everyone was very nice and friendly. was pleasantly surprised with how much i enjoyed the food there. would go back, about as expensive as dave and busters but a better place for kids.",5
"okay.....i've only been here about ten times, and stayed here just once but it's definitely growing on me. 

i primarily utilize the sportsbook and they are more than gracious with their drinks comps for your plays. when i do play, i play video blackjack and a bit of slots and roulette and i have been nothing but impressed with the comps.

i have only stayed in their room one time and was greatful that it was comped due to my gameplay.

this seems to be a popular spot, it's clean, always busy but not packed and has something for everybody....big sportsbook, lots of food options, movie theater etc. 

i would definitely recommend south point.",4
very  busy  spot  reservation  is  recommended  the  briyani  is really good  try  the    chicken 65 and cauliflower  65 as well  great  place  for  vegetarians.  full of  flavour  and  spice,5
"this is hands down my favorite movie theatre. my husband and i go once a week. we love the seats and the popcorn. the service is usually amazing, but we did have quite a few hiccups last night, but i think they might be training new staff. one time - i can forgive them. i just hope it doesn't become the norm.  i'm happy for them that they are so busy that they need more staff, but i'm sad for me bc i love this jewel and want it to myself.
the popcorn : hubby loves the plain with butter. i love the cheese so you can do half and half.
the food: i've had the burger, chicken fingers and fries, cantina bowl, nachos, and cool hand luke salad. the food is decent, but not gourmet. i'm ok with that though bc it is movie theatre after all. their fries are really good!
the drink: i hate that they have pepsi vs coke, but they have tuscon blonde beer - love that. 
for the price and experience i prefer roadhouse to ipic and all harkins.",4
fantastic nitro cold brew and always friendly service. the nitro is especially good in a chilled glass!,5
"we stopped in to try siam thai kitchen yesterday, and we are glad we did.  my husband had spicy basil pork and loved it.  i had yellow curry which was absolutely delicious.  the wontons were wonderful, too.  the menu includes lunch specials that are inexpensive (really, about the same price as mcdonalds) with wontons and an egg roll.  both their dinner and lunch menus are extensive.  the service and cleanliness were excellent, as well.  we can't wait to try more dishes.  if supporting local business owners while getting tasty food at a good price is important to you, stop in and give this restaurant a try!",5
"a nice place to have late night dinner. the funny thing we encounter is karaoke. we were laughing so loud we thought they will kick us out. the lady wasn't a good singer but she really tried. 
the food was ok, nothing special we could remember.",3
absolutely loved this place. tried the linguine shrimp & scallop with some type of spicy cod roll with it. it was very good. also had the balsamic soft shell crab but i think they forgot the balsamic as it seemed the crab was in a buttery garlic sauce. also had the fried oysters. they were good as well but the tartar sauce they serve with them was so bland it needed a bit of seasoning. also ordered the seafood pescator which was excellent as well. looking forward to going back & trying other dishes. waitstaff was very helpful with menu as it had been our first time there. 4 stars since the tartar sauce & soft shell crab was a bit off.,4
intensely flavorful and delectably creamy  -- how does it possibly get any better than that??  gelato-intense flavor infused into ice cream that is the perfect midway point between hard ice cream and soft ice cream -- lickable without a hint of dripping.  just pure flavor in creamy deliciousness bite after bite.  and the servers are so nice!!! omg if only i lived in cleveland.,5
"extremely rude customer service from their takeout server. the manager, however, apologized for his rudeness and comped our takeout order. we were 1 minute after closing and he gave us attitude and a temper tantrum in front of my kids.",1
"one star for the staff, they really are great and personable; another star for the design and aesthetics of the building.

a couple of things that really detract from the experience here:
1. pet urine. the residents here are very inconsiderate with their pets. the property even has a designated patch of grass for the dogs to take care of business, but a large percentage of of the people living here think it's fine if their dog pees on the sidewalk, steps, and even in the elevators.
2. paper-thin walls and ceilings. i could hear my upstairs neighbor's digital alarm, when she was opening and closing her dresser drawers, walking, moving stuff, etc.
3. residents parking in the visitor parking spots. anytime i invited friends over all the parking was taken by cars that were there every day.

this place has a lot of potential, but too many of the people who manage to rent here are low class and inconsiderate.

raise your prices level. :) cheers.",2
great selection and customer service and they actually close at 8. the staff in the store was so helpful and courteous.,5
"this review is for the courtyard grill & buffet on the 2nd floor.  came here when it was closing. got the last piece of prime rib and it was huge due to closing time. it's bigger than advertised. i got the fries and they gave alot of them. prime rib was delicious even though it was sitting there. my friend had the ny steak and it was great. service was excellent too. we both got mr. pibb, the waiter gave us the pitcher.

i would come here again but many other places to try while visiting.",4
"friendly and personal service.  food very good, fresh and nicely prepared.  ever hear of complimentary soup?  we never did either, and man it was good, homemade, hot, and delicious.
highly recommend lunch, we wish we'd had breakfast.  place very busy, with good reason.  lovely and clean. get there if you are ever in south charlotte!",5
"went for lunch today, to try the potato egg pizza - after seeing it reviewed in a magazine about best of charlotte.

i would have given this 4 stars, because the service was a little off. however, that being said, there was this awful woman (customer) sitting next to us who started screaming like a spoiled child over the slowness of the service. i'm talking, full-on temper tantrum. and the staff all responded with such graciousness, that i didn't even care anymore that it took awhile to get service when we first got there. 

now ...... on to the food!!!

we got the pesto garlic bread. it arrived in a little cast iron skillet, and looked actually like cinnamon rolls. very well presented. the pesto was delicious, and we loved it.

i had the potato egg pizza, which i can't even begin to describe how good this was. not a combination i ever would have thought of, but wow. my husband had the sausage fennel pizza, and his also was amazing (i had a slice of his). both pizza's had very distinctive flavoring, and were very memorable.

can't wait to return and try some of the other pizza's.

and to the woman sitting next to us - get a grip. i'm sorry you had to wait a whole extra 10 minutes for your meal due to restaurant error. but there's no need to belittle the servers. and no need to ruin my meal by having to watch your bad behavior. next time, please quietly go get speak to the manager. thank you.",5
"i've been to pickle barrel at this location several times.

food quality & price: everything on the menu is similarly priced between $10 - $18 for entrees ($20+ for beef).  appetizers around $10+. one reason i like the pickle barrel is for their extensive menu.  their portions are large which means i always have to take home food. the quality of the food is decent, no complaints but not spectacular.  i enjoyed their pasta but my husband felt that the steak had too much fat and gristle.

facility: ambiance is nice, decor is nice. from what i can see\/tell the eating space was clean.  chairs were well maintained as were utensils and napkins. pretty typical of a chain restaurant. 

service: complete hit and miss.  the first few times we came to this location, our service seem kind of ""empty"".  everyone seemed robotic and rehearsed. i requested lunch portions outside of lunch hours (dinner time) and the results were always inconsistent. first visit, my request was accommodated without an issue.  second time, apparently it caused all hell to break loose in the kitchen, the floor manager came out to see us to tell us it cannot be done. hey, i just wanted to be honest and not let food go to waste. third time, my request went through without issue. from them on, though, i didn't bother but it did affect my overall opinion on the establishment. 

waiters\/waitresses (as i noted before) used to be pretty robotic.  but our last visit was great, our waitress was kind and funny (but not flirty - as handsome as he is, flighty servers annoy me). our waitress was young but knew all the cues (when to leave, checking in at the right times\/paces etc).

overall: it's a good place to go to explore the large menu options (downside is that since there are so many items on the menu, they are generally mediocre). don't expect ""excellent"" service or the same quality of experience twice.  the over theme seems to be ""inconsistency"". 

i will probably return (out of convenience) but personally, and as others have said, i think i prefer the yorkdale location.",3
"friends from virginia and various places in california come together on our annual visit to las vegas for german food.  we were saddened our favorite german restaurant was closed, but found an authentic and delicious new menu at cafe berlin.
the gulasch soup was outstanding.  other menu items we enjoyed included jaeger schnitzel, nuerberger rostbratwurst, breaded pork cutlets sautéed w\/gravy and sausage at its best.
the owners were very warm and welcoming, and the restaurant was bright and cheerful. it has become out annual 'must visit' restaurant in las vegas!",5
this is our go to thai restaurant at work.  we family style so we've tasted many dishes and i love them all. staff is nice and delivers in a timely manner!,4
"so this is a small business operation, and they have lots of different options to get your freeze on when vegas is trying burn you alive.  i came here with my guy a couple weeks back to try to beat the heat.  they have a small handful of frozen yogurt options available at a time, however they always have all their flavors available in frozen yogurt shave ice.  the one downside to this option is you only get one flavor, which partly defeats one of the reasons i love going for self serve. i love not having to just choose one, so i staired at the board for 5 minutes as if i were deciding the fate of the world....and it's fate was matcha green tea frozen yougurt.  with this i was allowed 3 toppings.  now the toppings you see before you are not the only toppings, i wanted traditional boba, none of this flavored popping madness, and they had some in the back since they also sell boba drinks, i also got taro custard, and mochi peices.  for under 5 dollars it was huge! and she artfully placed the toppings between the shavings.  i do regret the condensed milk that is optional, the ice cream was to sweet to add it making it a bit cloying where it touched it.  

now my boyfriend went crazy pants and got a lot of of frozen yogurt, and then was like this needs a waffle cone, and now it needs more frozen yogurt in the waffle cone! now i will say that waffle cone was delicious.  i usually am not seduced by them, thinking they taste like cardboards cousin.  these were not, they were her naughty neighbor that brings all the boys to the yard. i still dream of it.  i am converted. 

now overall the women at the desk was super helpful, i do think it's odd still you can't have a half half option like snowflake shavery does for their shave ice cream.  i also prefer their green tea, but still do like it here.  one weird thing you need a key to get in the bathroom...this place isn't in a rough neighborhood attracting homeless wanting to bathe in the sink, nor is it a heavily trafficked area that gets hoards of non paying bathroom users...so i don't get why it must be so complicated for me to have to relieve myself after eating copious amounts of calories.  however, i do think they are a good spot you should check out.  they have so many options, something is bound to tickle your fancy.",4
"my back is injured so i can't paint my own toes, and my nail polish chipped yesterday so i went to get a nail polish change. the technician took off my polish and put new polish on. not gel, not acrylic, just plain black nail polish. she also added a $5 design. very quick service, in and out. i go to check out and she runs my card for $40. i told her woah there you just changed my polish, $40 is a bit much. she said oh my mistake, it is $30. i asked how much a full pedicure is and she said $35. i asked how can a simple nail polish change cost $5 less than a full pedicure? she goes and gets someone else and they both are laughing while speaking in another language and the other woman says it's $30. i once again ask why there is only a $5 difference between a 10 min service and an hour service. they laugh again and she says okay, you're right, it's $15. seriously wtf is going on here?! so she says i have to sign the card transaction for $40 and hands me $25 in cash. they continue laughing, i still tip $5, and i left. not only did the salon appear to be dirty, she also had a mustard bottle in her tool kit filled with who knows what, and used a restaurant napkin to separate my toes during the polish. she didn't speak to me at all during the service, she just spoke to the other nail techs the entire time. worst nail salon experience i have ever had. i never argue about price, so overall it made me extremely uncomfortable to even bring up, but knew i was being substantially over charged.",1
"not impressed, 40 minute wait for our table even with a reservation.  certainly understaffed.  won't be back.",1
"i had my birthday\/valentine's dinner here with my boyfriend last night, and boy was it busy! thank goodness we made reservations (although they had to bump it up an hour, but no biggie). 

and because we did, we ended up with probably the best seats in the house: a private booth near the back, complete with a buzzer for our server. i have to admit, it was pretty neat!

anyway, we got some specials - blue fin sashimi and baigai, along with about 5 other courses. kobe beef fillet with wasabi, tsukune grilled ground chicken, chicken breast wrapped in chicken skin, raku's tofu, and their melting chocolate cake.

i loved that the servers let us know different ways to enhance the food, and (considering i am dating a chef) was able to answer every question thrown at them. the sashimi was superb - very young, and i have to say, putting the soysauce nori on top with wasabi was a kicker! the baigai threw me off a bit; it was our first time eating snail, and it was delicious. kobe beef, always a great pick, and both chickens were just yummy - the aroma and taste took me straight back home. the tofu was probably my favorite! perfect consistency, heavenly with the soysauce. the melting chocolate cake was also nummy - however, i wish the green tea ice cream was a little more, well, green tea-ish. 

needless to say, i was stuffed. very stuffed and happy. if you want to be, too, go to raku!!",5
"we went there for dinner at a gameless night. i had a steak burger and my friend had a turkey burger. the service was good, and the person serving us was very quick to attend to our needs. my burger wasn't very good. the meat was kinda dry and it was very though to chew and it didn't have a lot of flavor. my friends turkey sandwich was good. 

the bathrooms are very weird. they have very little light inside. 

overall it's got a good atmosphere and its a pleasant place, and we had a good time. too bad the food wasn't the best, but we'll be going back for another try some other time.",3
"went here with bf on a monday night. not a busy night for the restaurant. there were only about 5 to 6 tables occupied with just a couple per table. 

i noticed immediately that the service was a little slow and was a little unorganized. we were seated though immediately but the orders were taken after 15 minutes. i mentioned it was kind of unorganized because after the male server took our orders, after 5 minutes the female server approached our table and asked if our orders were taken.

now let's rate the food...

i can say the fish quality was good, fish was very fresh and firm (nigiris).

grilled seafood was so so... i've eaten better.

deep fried items were also so so... the soft shell crab that i ordered was drenched in oil. also they don't put the dipping sauce on the side but they just drizzle it and it makes the dish more wet rather than crispy and light on the outside and moist in the inside

rolls were okay... i ordered the tuna tataki (rating: 7 out of 10) and snow white (4 out of 10). 

i can say though that the seared tuna with aj sauce was something different and it was really good. too bad it's only 1 order per person.

desserts... also ordinary and it's one per person too. we tried the mango mochi and tempura ice cream.

maybe we will be back, i say goyemon is still the best ayce in town!",3
"not the best and not the worst dim sum in markham.  it's in pacific mall, which houses a lot of bad restaurants and food stands, so this one is the better option.  all red walls make for a unique ambiance.  the food is typical shanghai dim sum of average quality.",3
sugar slam!! i stumbled onto this place as i was looking for a very quick snack to quell my rumbling tummy. i was so happy to see they had my favorite- macarons for $1.50! they were not super delicate melt in my mouth but i would definitely get them again. they also have cookies and cupcakes for that 4 o clock sugar fix. the owner is super friendly and talkative. i tried one cupcake (white chocolate frosting with red velvet cake) and it was heavenly. looking forward to trying them again soon.,4
"staff here is super friendly. place seemed a little dirty though. the movie felt overly loud, but otherwise it is a neat place to have a bite to eat while watching a movie on a hot summer day! i think their menu is a 2-3 star. not super impressed with the food. it needs to be better quality for sure.",3
"came to this place with my wife. the location was good, decor and atmosphere was relaxing. the menu offerings were to our liking; we're very adventurous and the asian fusion fits our palates well. check out their happy hour. great prices and they offer it every day. we'll be back again for sure.",5

"i went here with my boyfriend for valentine's day.  we had the sampler with wine pairings, and overall it was a good fine dining experience.  the wait staff was very courteous, and even moved us to a different table when ours was a bit wobbly.  however, they are serious when they mean ""samplers"", in which i finished the sampler and was still hungry.  also it was super expensive! the food was great nonetheless and the presentation was meticulous.   we ordered the steak, which was huge and that filled me up.  i may try v picasso on a different, non-holiday date when the prices aren't astronomical and the portions are larger.",3
went here for lunch today. service was good. sushi was yummy! i would definitely come here again!,5
i really enjoyed the food here. fast service and great location right by the metro.,4
"the food here, the 2 times that i have been is good.  however, both times i have experienced very poor service due to them being understaffed.  i was last there  a couple thursdays ago around 6-7pm.  the place was completely packed.  unfortunately, it looked like there were only 3 waitresses for the entire place, so the bartender who was taking care of the entire bar (also packed) was having to wait tables, and bring all the drinks to the tables instead of the waitresses doing this.  by the time our pizza finally came (20 minutes after having to ask where is was, since we had been there an hour), it was completely cold, so we sent it back to get warmed up.

all the food tastes great, the bartender was very apologetic and completely frazzled. i felt bad for them.  they need better management to figure out better wait staff to customer ratio for their high volume times.  hope they figure it out.  i'll try back in a few months",2
"tacos are delicious! drinks are delicious. ambiance outside was nice. service was great and very friendly. 

we've been here a few times now and on our last visit, the taco of the month was a soft tortilla wrapped around a hard shell stuffed with braised beef, whole beans, some kind of bbq sauce, and other deliciousness. it was crazy good. we've both never had a taco like it. i just love how the owner presents food that isn't redundant to other places. i also ordered two other tacos that were on the menu (didn't make my own) and they were delicious. we also got the regular quac which was super good, and the complimentary chips and salsa are yummy! i was still eating them after dinner when my stomach was full to capacity and i could hardly move. i know...but i couldn't help myself.",4
"so, i don't know why this is labeled under ""happy valley fast food restaurant"", but the sign on the front says ""xtreme taste."" 

got to be the best deal in the area. a take out shop run by two very nice ladies who make yummy cheap food.

my favorite is the sea bass plate. for $6, a plate filled with a nice slab of tender sea bass, a skewer of shrimp, a few pieces of tender calamari, rice, and 2-3 types of salad. it's enough for 2 meals really, though i always end up eating the whole thing. often the line will be out the door (it's a very small place) but the line moves quickly.

the veggie plate is $5 and plate full of salad and a veggie patty. you can also get a small or large salad tray for cheap.",5
"we have been here several times since moving to henderson. it's always been pretty good which is why we went back. after yesterday, we will never go back. there are so many food options in vegas and henderson that to be treated with poor service, i'd rather spend my money elsewhere. 

it started from the moment we walked in. for some reason the hostess had an attitude, barely said two words to us, walked us to the table, put our menus on the table without a word, and walked away. then it took about 10 min before anyone came up. mind you this was 1:15 on friday. by no means busy. we were ready to order, and i told the waitress we were in a hurry because we were on a lunch break. i ordered the monte cristo which clearly states on the menu comes with hash browns or home fried potatoes, something like that. when i order, she says do you want french fries. threw me off because that wasn't a choice. then the coffee cake was burnt on the bottom. why would you even serve that. that's always been my favorite thing there. we ate the top but it just wasn't as good. you could clearly tell there was a problem with it and she never asked about it the entire time we were there. in fact, she left the plate with all its burnt crumbs on our table the the entire meal. it's like she wanted us to be taunted by it. 

then the food came about a good 15 min later. we are starting to panic by this point because we have to get back to work. there is no way all of this should have taken closer to an hour. i have a deep fried sandwich for crying out loud. i swear she put our food in late. we know that doesn't take that long. when the food comes, i ask for the check right away, and my daughter asks for ranch. she's brings the check but we never see the ranch nor do we see her again. not once. i had to ask a bus boy for a container for the rest of my sandwich. which by the way the sandwich was burnt as well. very crispy.

you have to pay up front. the person up there asks how it was, and i said ""not good"". she either is inexperienced on how to handle that response or she just didn't care. all i heard in response was her mumbling under her breath ""oh sorry to hear that"" as she's facing the cash register ringing me out. that's it. we'll take our money elsewhere.",1

"i came here friday evening during the christmas  market.. and let me just say all chocolate lovers need to come here! now!

when we got inside we noticed a short line of people so we waited about maybe 15 mins for a table. once seated, my bf and i were looking at the menu and decided on the sweet experience for two. it consists of milk chocolate fondue with strawberries, bananas, marshmellows, chocolate covered cereal(? don't remember), a grill to roast your marshmallows, a side of waffles with vanilla ice cream and finally a small hot chocolate. that was about $26 something so prices are definitely on the higher side.

when we got our fondue set, the server forgot to bring us our utensils. so we were just staring at the food with our hungry eyes! luckily, i waved down our original server and he brought us our utensils and plates. 

the fondue set itself was amazing, the milk chocolate was rich and creamy! just like how it's suppose to be. same with the hot chocolate i was really impressed! anyways, food was great, service was fine. i'll definitely be back because i wanna try their crêpes!",4
i went to jupe to get a gift for my girlfriend.  the store is small but has a ton of different styles of clothing and the staff was more than willing to help me out.  in the end she loved her gift - making it a successful trip.,4
"i love the chicken alfredo pasta at goodscents, and of course the amazing cookies. i came here tonight for my meal and unfortunately they forgot to give me my breadstick with it, which are also delicious. can also be hit or miss on the staff---some are super friendly and some are either more reserved or just want to get you out of there. overall, i'm a regular and i like it.",3
"the irish nachos were excellent.  we went during happy hour for half price apps.  we got a half order of the naxos with corned beef and we could not finish them.
i would go again!",4
highly disappointed. we decided to order a large pizza... where it was all dough and no sauce or cheese. we order the mushrooms balls that were surprising good and actually warm unlike anything else on the order... mozzarella sticks haven't been cooked yet and asking for extra sauce will get you enough make pasta for the week so i guess that's a plus? otherwise... overrated.. over priced... and next time i'll just stay hungry.,2
"the service here, is sooo bad! we were meeting family, happened to be running behind them and when we got there they were eating already, it took the waiter 20 min just to come take our drink order, another 10 min to come with the drinks and take our order...thought we were good,wrong! after 45 min. i asked about or food& by the time they came out, approx 5-8 min later, family started leaving, and we just began eating! i will never go there again! they were packed so i could understand a little delay, but come on! 45 min to receive a few of the simplest plates on the menu, um no.",1

you guys need to work on your shi*.",1
"the hotel is nice for the price. the only problem is... when i arrived i checked in and the toilet still had poo stuck to the side. not ok... which in return made me think every last bit of that hotel room was not cleaned.. plus it didn't help that my one pillow literally smelled a bit of cologne or something not like the rest.. and not fabric softener.. whatever the smell was.. not ok.. there was also a pair of headphones on the chair that were left behind. kinda grossed out.. 

if i get pinkeye or a staph infection i'll be sure to update my review with 1 star...",2
fastest service i've ever received!!! food is the bomb!!!! and the server is amazing wish i would've got his name but sweetest man ever! this will be my new go to mexican spot forsure. thank you frank and finas!!!,5
lunch leaves a lot to be desired. service was very slow and not friendly.  lunch menu has nothing really on it. my chicken was cold and salad was drowned in dressing. i couldn't even eat it. i was very disappointed and out seventy five dollars.,1
pretty disappointed ate here last week it wasn't great. food was excellent but the service was horrendous. waiter took forever to get out drinks and he kept looking the other way when i was talking to him. talk about rude. this was the first and last time going to lawrys las vegas.,2
"ouch!!! i should have checked their yelp reviews before i went to purrfect auto on eastern ave near st. rose.

a relatively small problem on my emissions test, turned into an initial ""quote"" of nearly $800.  i actually felt like the manager was looking at me as if i represented his next house payment.  

as i tried to pay the diagnostic fee and leave, he mysteriously found a way to cut the sales tax and some of the labor out of the package.  now for only $700 he could make my car pass emissions.  

no, again... 

then came the final pitch: for only a $200 ""deposit"", he could keep my diagnostic paperwork active until i could come back and get the work done.

nope!  i'll pay the non-refundable diagnostic fee and leave.  i then requested a copy of the diagnostic print out (since i paid for it).  to add insult to my near miss, they gave me an official looking paper which they said was the report ... turns out that it was just my invoice, with an ""itemization"" of the things they ""recommended"".

lesson learned!

btw, my car is currently at another facility for the same repair.  that place only found one sensor to be defective not the two sensors that purrfect wanted to replace.",1
it's a starbucks...what can i say other than it's as great as every starbucks i've been to!  friendly service and a consistant product.  yay!,4
"i eat a lot of thai food; this place is definitely one of my favorites.  why? cause it's right down the street from me and the closest thai restaurant around.  however, it's not to say it's not good; it's excellent.  i like the small and local own restaurants that have great food.  from the outside it doesn't look like much, matter fact it looks like some dive thai food place, but inside they have a pretty nice setup.  i always gage thai food by their drunken noodles - don't know why, but love it!  recommendation and thumbs up for this place :)",4
"i love, love, love everything about liberty market! 

everything from the staff to the food and their selection of wine and beer. i'm a frequent diner at liberty market, and while you can usually find me there for their amazing breakfasts during the week, i'm also a huge fan of dinner as well, especially since they mix up the menu on the weekends and usually have something different every week.

if you have a chance, get your butt out here! it's amazing! (p.s. my faves: cortado and the demi-breakfast with a blueberry pancake and bacon! yummy!)",5
"this place truly was therapy!! first, our waitress was simply outstanding. i'm sorry that i don't recall her name, but she knew everything about the food and ingredients and the best way to eat each small plate that we ordered. there were 3 of us so we ordered 5 small plates and split them. each one was unique and perfectly prepared and presented. i would go back a zillion times!! an absolute must if you're on fremont street!",5

"met sydney and allan and they were able to take me right away. sydney took the time to find out what i wanted. and i got a very attentive, unrushed, cut. 

i also opted for a beard trim and shave. *that* was great. i haven't had a hairdresser who paid attention to my beard or go-t for a long time (eric @ donato's to be exact--where did you go dude!). 

and sydney was really a pro with the straight razor. if you haven't had shave with a straight razor it's worth the try. it's the closest you'll come to a spa day as a man without feeling, mmm, effeminate ;-) 

i don't think i would call the place retro... it's just queen w. like getting your hair cut at czehoski or something.

anyway, without even mentioning the über-reasonable prices, it was great.",4
"hello, please franchise to denver. quick-serve delicious caribbean would kill it here.

stopped into the shak for lunch while visiting some friends in toronto. i couldn't resist getting jerk chicken, and i'm sure glad i did. perhaps spicy food wasn't the best play while already sweating from the heat outside, but it sure was delicious. cooked perfectly, still moist and tender, the jerk spice was perfect. they give you extra so you can drown your fries\/sides in the same jerk magic. i also got a house-made hot sauce (some variation of carrots, citrus, and habaneros) to dip my fries \/ chicken in. 

stopped in at the tail end of the lunch rush, and the staff was friendly and took great care of us. i'm tremendously sad that quick, affordable jamaican is so far away.",4
"wanted to give 5 stars, but just not quite there.

food was very good. two in the group had the beet and hummus sandwich and said it was very good.  another had the burger and said is was good. i had the chicken thigh sandwich which was good, but not great. (food is 3.5 stars)

the bar is excellent.  they have a nice beer selection and know how to make good craft cocktails.  very nice. (bar is 5 stars)

they also were very professional and able to accommodate a sever peanut allergy with one of the members of our party. (service and attitude 5 stars)

what was odd was the very loud heavy metal being played.  i don't mean loud and a bit edgy. i mean silly loud.  at 7:30 pm.  it was odd and took quite a bit away from the experience.",4
"we tried this place no long after it opened and had a coupon.  i'm always willing to try new chinese restaurants since i can't seem to find many good ones in the phoenix area. 

the food was edible.. we will not be going back.",2
"came here with family on a sunday night and ordered a bunch of different meals. although the ambience was very promising when you walk in and looks nice and clean, the service and food was the exact opposite. 

beef bento box - stale salad, beef was chewy and hard and lots of tendons.
seafood ramen soup - tasted worse than instant noodles
spicy salmon sushi- tasted off, might not have been fresh 


overall the waitress just stood there and didnt bring our drinks or give us timely service. so wouldnt come back here again.",1
"so glad to find this salon! i travel a fair amount, and in toronto about twice a year. i just needed a blow out. i read a lot of reviews from different sources and these guys looked the most promising. my hair is naturally very frizzy, curly and hard for me to do - not very attractive. when i get blow outs away from home, it seems to get frizzy after a day. this time it was great and stayed that way - even without using a bunch of products in it. also, they could not be any nicer.  i'm very happy!",5
"ordered the round trip from airport to hotel and back for our four night stay in pittsburgh.

plane landed on time, and i sent them a text that we had landed and are getting our bags.

got to the super shuttle counter at pittsburgh international airport. and still had to wait 15 minutes for pick up.

the driver was nice enough, however i was disturbed that he kept looking and sending messages on his mounted dispatch touchscreen ipad while he was driving on the highway, at highway speeds, in the rain, instead of keeping his eyes on the road.  and i told him so.

on the return trip, we were texted to be ready at 8:10am. the super shuttle van did not show up until 8:52am.

unacceptable.",2
"my husband and i had dinner here last weekend. i love thai food and i am always on the look out for great new places. charm was amazing. we were greeted by our waiter christian and received our drinks promptly. christian let us know that happy hour was now being offered on saturday as well. i ordered one of their signature drinks and my husband thai iced tea. my drink was soooo good and my husband said his tea was the best he had ever had! we ordered coconut shrimp and summer rolls for appetizers and they came out quickly and were really yummy. for entrees i ordered yellow curry and the hubs got a sauteed veggie and chicken dish. let me just say, when ordering my curry i asked them to kick up the heat and omg, it was awesome! it was so good i have been thinking and obsessing about getting back to charm to have it again. the ingredients of all the dishes were fresh and lovely. the presentation above and beyond. service a ten! this is my new favorite place for thai food.",5
"wow!! this place is amazing!! 

let me start off with their customer service is #1. i was constantly always being taken care of whether it be taking away plates, refilling the chip bowl, refill drinks, and making sure everything is okay. they also had all smiles on their faces as it was a pleasure to take care of their customers. on top of that, i came during dinner which was extremely busy. but i was seated right away and taken care of

once my order was placed, it wasn't even 10 minutes until i got my order. i was surprised with how fast i received my fresh order. even though it was fast, the food was great!!

overall, i would definitely recommend this place for one of your local mexican spots. the environment is festive with all the decorations, everyone is happy, and the workers are  constantly helping you. there's also a live mariachi band that comes around the tables and perform.

ps. you are served with chips, salsa, and bean dip in the beginning. and pretty much all plates come with rice, beans, and soup unless you get something off the al a carte.

enjoy! you've gotta check this place out",5
erika is the best stylist out there. i love the atmosphere and just all the lovely stylists there. they are all super talented. erika is adorable (especially when she starts laughing). i went in after not doing anything with my hair for over six months (because i'm lame). she didn't lecture me about the lack of follow through. she also gave me the most amazing red hair. i would recommend this salon. the prices are reasonable and you will have a great time and experience.,5

always takes my order and tyler is always asking if i need anything

the sub's are great also",5
"stopped here for a quick pit stop, had a car full of uniformed person ell and that caught the employees attention. this being said, my experience could have been skewed by this.

my beverage was great, and that was the general consensus. the service was infallible and perky. everything was with a smile.. but what caught me was the phrase ""taste it, if you don't like it you get something else"" - now that something i usually just have seen written on the wall with paint in small mexican restaurants. i like it!

it's all you want\/need in a small drive-through coffee joint - i will come back.",4

set up the bedroom. set up is included.  

i also must note i live in a condo. nicely done. 

i highly recommend.",5
"less variety, but nice food.  good deep fried tempura vegetables and ice cream.",4
"there was nothing overtly above-average about this restaurant that would warrant a solid thumbs up. we walked in with no reservation, and when we were seated prior to our estimated wait time we were pleased. that came to an end by the time we were seated. we waited around 10 minutes to be introduced to our waitress and get our orders in. there was an average of 20 minute increments between getting our drinks (besides water) food, any refills and the check. this was a thursday evening towards the end of the night, no reason at all for service to take that long.
as far as the food goes, it was okay. the spinach dip appetizer was hot and full of flavor, definitely a large enough portion to share with 3-4 people. i had the campanelle carbonara which had an overwhelming flavor of bacon. it literally took over the entire dish. my boyfriend had the chicken limone which was a nice well-rounded entree between the meat and veggies. dessert was a torta di cioccolata and was the best part of the entire meal- melted chocolate inside the cake complements very nicely with the scoop of vanilla gelato.
maybe we'll come back for happy hour next time, i've heard good things. hopefully we score with better service than this evening.",3

"like others have said this place is fine for a quick bite to eat around lunch time, but it isn't great. their lunch menu consist of about 6-7 options with your choice of protein. the lunch special comes with a soup, spring roll, entree, and tea for a reasonable price. not the best thai i've ever had, but not the worst. 

the service was friendly and prompt, but the food came out so quick it was obvious that the food was not made to order. i suspect they cook large vats of the dishes and simply add spice to the specification of each order. i expect my food cooked to order...point blank...no discussion. not sure it would be my first choice for a lunch, but if someone else chose it i wouldn't be adamant about not going.",3

"so aside from the fact that i feel like i am stalking the barman, this place was fab. i had a few lovely gin and tonics with an good amount of cucumber in each one ( true test to a good g&t ) and i was overly chuffed to see an amazing selection of classic games... i don't know what its like on the weekends but on a weeknight for a cheeky drink this place is a keeper. i had the nicest time & can't wait to head back to try downstairs ( question though... if boys don't know downstairs is there... and they don't use the ladies bathroom, how do they know it exists ) secret women's business maybe xx",4
"having just come back from nyc, i was excited to check this place out with the missus after reading all of the glowing yelp reviews about ""ny-style"" pizza here in toronto. could it be true? i mean, would it really be possible to get pizza like grimaldi's, lombardi's, patsy's or ray's here in toronto? unfortunately, i'm sorry to say the answer is no.

the food - we both split a bomba which is a large meatball drizzled in tomato sauce and accompanied with some fried cheesy dough. the dough was the best part though the meatball was ok. get it if you want but nothing to really write home about. 

we then ordered a large pepperoni pizza. definitely not ny-style pizza, and definitely not the best pizza in toronto (which, in my opinion, still ranks as: massimo's, bitondo's, terroni's, vesuvio's, libretto's). if you happen to be up by marlee and eglinton and you really want to try their pizza, go ahead. the portions are huge. however, do not come with the expectation that this is the best pizza in toronto. 

the atmosphere - the place was clean and nicely decorated. the staff behind the counter were friendly.",2
"no complaints here! i just used this place as a pit stop to get a huge mai tia slurpee which was awesome! it was $14 bucks with 2 extra shots of vodka & refills were $7 bucks; nevertheless i refilled that bad boy up the following evening on my way to the the miracle mile shops in planet hollywood. the drink actually taste really good, not like some of the other frozen drinks you run into on the strip. everyone knows there a dime a dozen. the waitress was a sweetheart, really attentive, had a great personality & i will definitely be back. i like the set up of this location because its easy in -easy out! fast, quick, cheap, no hassle & i got my fix! good stuff",4

"i was on vacation and i found this particular restaurant through yelp and what a great find it was!  my wife and i had lasagna and then we got a pizza to go. both items were absolutely delicious. we also tried the house dressing on our salads. it was a kind of thick creamy italian dressing and it was excellent.
it's a small family run operation. the kind of place where you walk in and order at the counter and then have a seat. the place is very clean and well lit. it is located in a shopping center so there is plenty of parking. 
so if you are looking for a good fairly priced italian restaurant without any pretense check this one out. you won't be disappointed.",4
"honestly, given the level of vitriol in some of the reviews here, i was expecting the worst from chef of india. but it's really not that bad. (i've had much, much better indian food, but i've also had far worse.)

we ordered two dishes: vegetable korma and chicken vindaloo.

the chicken vindaloo (""chicken cooked with red hot chillies with potatoes in hot and sour gravy"") is clearly the superior of the two. the sauce is rich and spicy, while the fairly plentiful chicken was devoid of bad, inedible pieces. (it might've been a little dried out, admittedly.) the presence of a bay leaf notwithstanding, i really enjoyed eating this dish.

not so much with the vegetable korma (""mixed vegetables cooked with cashew nuts, onion, cream and spices""), unfortunately. first and most egregious, the vegetables had clearly emerged directly from a bag out of the freezer, as they were uniformly soggy and tasteless. (the telltale jagged cut on the pieces of carrot gave it away immediately.) other than that, the sauce was hopelessly bland and devoid of spice, so there was really nothing within this dish that worked.

i mean, would i ever order from chef of india again? probably not, given the wealth of other, better options in the area. but you could do worse in a pinch.",3
"stopped for dine in a while back, nice atmosphere and decent food.  only question is why do so many pizza places anymore, dice all the toppings into teeny-tiny tidbits, feels like i'm at an amish country salad bar (they do the same thing) or assisted living facility.  would prefer nice cuts and chunks of peppers, onion, on the pie.......not teeny-tiny diced.  they do have options, so pay attention when you order.",3
waited an hour as a new patient even when told to come 30 minutes early... about three women were taken back before me. every station or room i went i waited even longer. and not only that but the nurses were condescending and also a little strange. by the time i saw dr. gatlin it had been two hours since i arrived. as a new patient is this how you want me to remember your office?,1

net: if you want nathans, go to the luxor. if you have to eat at the fashion show mall, i suggest making the walk to chipotle by nordstrom, or the nordstrom cafe itself.",3

got 2 free tickets to the mac king comedy magic show at harrah casino. the only catch was that you had to purchase 1 drink per person which is about ten dollars. the show is about one hour long and it was fun. had a lot of great laughs and was entertained throughout the show. great for kids. mac king will ask people to come upstage to help with his magic tricks. the show is in a small theater venue.,5
"been searching nevada for the best boba tea spot and tea space boba was not the best i've had and sadly does not deserve 5 stars. tea space claims they make there boba hot and fresh in every drink but the honey boba was too hard and chewy because they were not cooked. flavor portions were also off. my smoothie milk tea was too sweet while a friends hokkaido milk tea was too watery. however, the atmosphere was great and has plenty of space for a large crowd which is better than most boba spots provide. otherwise 2 star rating because of drink quality.",2
"the arepera was a gem tucked into a corner spot in plateau mont-royal and was a resounding success! after living in a proverbial desert of latin food in ri, our trip to montreal offered the sabor we had been missing for so long. 

the wait was about 20 min on a sunday afternoon, not too bad since the weather was comfortable. the wait list is a dry erase board next to the door. it's not easily noticeable and some folks seemed to miss it at first. 

talk about amazing food choices. while i love arepa sandwiches, my wife and i both settled for the plato de pabellón; her choice was the stewed chicken and mine was the roasted pork. the platters are a phenomenal portion given the price, plenty of food but not overkill. the pork was outstanding and the arepa was, hands down, the best arepa i ever had. definitely recommend the side of venezuelan guacamole to go with. and the sauces! one chile-based spicy, one avocado-based mild... both amazing!! go there!!",5

"this place is basically a sports bar. plain and simple. if you want bar food and drinks then this is the place for you!

i came around 6pm on friday and was seated at the bar promptly. no complaints there. service began rather quickly and we decided on onion rings as a starter and a couple mojitos while we sorted through the menu.

the onion rings were very good and the dipping sauce reminded me of the sauce outback uses with their blooming onion. 

the mojitos we got were the angry berry mojitos with the angry orchard in them. my wife had a sip and hated it so she opted for another one, which the manager happily replaced and didn't charge us for. i didn't mind mine.

we both ordered small orders of wings in caribbean jerk and hot flavors. the jerk was spicy yet sweet and quite good. the hot was exactly how it sounds.

we ordered another round of mojitos which came out quick. we also ordered some cheese curds, but they never came out. we had to cancel our order because we'd had enough of the noise after sitting for an hour waiting.

if you get here during the slower times, the place is pretty good. if you happen to be here during the rush then prepare to suffer slow service and loud noise.",3

"we were having a large family reunion welcome party for 64 people and in the extreme heat of las vegas, we felt it would be so difficult to locate sufficient supplies of small bags of ice to set up the drink coolers.
i called ice now and received advice on how to arrange the ice delivery, and that there was a $100. minimum for 400# of ice.  you can choose the size of the bags for either 10# or 20#. 
we had confirmation of delivery and the driver initially approached our location a little earlier than the window of the afternoon we needed the ice. so he immediately responded to my text and agreed to come a couple of hours later as we had requested.
the delivery men were knowledgeable and arrived on time, and were great to deal with. this is a great service if you are planning to fill up plastic tubs with ice. in fact all evening through the next day, we stored some ice in a basement shower and ice lasted a long time.",5
"my friend loves this place, and we always go for her birthday.  the food is indeed fantastic.  i have had different crepes each time and they have both been wonderful and super filling.  the potatoes are also out of this world.  however, the food here is not the problem.  the service has been abysmal each time.  if your waitress seems unhappy and ill tempered it really ruins the whole experience.  and another star is lost due to the prices.  the crepe is on the small side for paying over $10, and the other dishes on the menu go up steeply in price after that.  generally, the side dishes are not included and you must pay extra for them.  this limits the menu options for those in your party that are on a tighter budget.  if price and rude wait staff are not your primary concerns then this is the place for you.",3

i got the thai tom yum w\/ coconut soup with japanese ramen noodles and you get to choose two toppings. i got the beef brisket and japanese style chashu (pork belly). my boyfriend ordered the singapore laksa base with udon noodles and topped with chashu and jumbo wanton (additional $1)  

i really liked the tom yum base it was delicious and thicker than the laksa base due to the coconut. it was savory while the laksa was more soup like and spicier. 

if you order noodles you get bubble tea for a cheaper price than on its own. i really enjoyed the matcha with tapioca and red bean. overall, the service was fast and great, the noodles were tasty and the bubble tea was average. i would definitely come back here again",4
"went here once, in 2007, on a first date with a hot chick i met while in college. almost six years later...she's my wife. yea, guess i'd say that's enough for 5 stars. thanks bread company *brofist*

do i remember much about the food?...no. the only thing i remember was feeling underwhelmed by the bread. i mean, if the place is called ""bread company"" i expect the bread to be something special, you know what i mean? whatever, i guess by now i'm over it.

bottom line: took my crush here on a first date, ended up getting a second date...a third...and yea, eventually i even got laid. thumbs up, would recommend.",5
"if you are at the waterfront and craving sushi, this is the place for you!  the sushi is made fresh. you can sit at the sushi bar to eat or at a table. they have a lot to choose from. they even have pictures of everything so you see what you are getting. my two favorites are the three rivers roll and the polumalu roll. 
they also have hibachi here. you can sit at one of the big tables or order it from your table at the sushi area. sometimes we order both and share. i dislike how loud the hibachi tables get and i wish there was more separation from the sushi area for the nights you just want a quiet dinner.",3
"not the greatest

stopped by today to pick up a recordable storybook for grandson. while they did help us find us, it was with some reluctance.

not very helpful and somewhat distracted.

three items, should have been about 10 mnutes turned into more than 30. should have been 10 with assistnace which was not forthcoming.",3
best gyros around. they have great fries and various sizes of gyros. i haven't been to their other locations but this one is great. tiny little dive on the inside but so delicious. great prices too.,5
"this year i finally got a chance to sign up and volunteer at the three square food bank. initially i called the food bank to sign up and the employee i spoke to informed me that i could sign-up online and view the volunteer calendar. at that point, i went online to the volunteer page and completed the forms. it only took a few minutes and after about 10-15 mins i was able to log in and view the calendar. 

i was able to volunteer several different days and during those days i worked in the volunteer room. in the volunteer room we sorted and box or bagged food for distribution by the food bank. the employees in this area were really nice and organized. the food bank also uses an electronic sign-in system for volunteers and automatically tracks your volunteers hours. each volunteer also has there own identification number which is also nice because it keeps things organized. 

i really hope to be able to volunteer again with three square and possibly work in one of the other volunteer areas like the kitchen preparing school lunches. i think the employees, building, and programs at the three square campus are all great. the building is clean and beautiful and i really can't wait to go back because my experience was so great. the organization of the staff really stood out and made me happy because i felt my time was used efficiently.  

fyi- i just learned that they some times offer saturday volunteer opportunities in the volunteer room in addition to the other weekend programs they offer.",5
"great staff. very friendly and helpful. 
food was fabulous.we went for breakfast. the options were egg related but you had a large selection including crepes. there are also fresh bakery items for something light.",5
"so today i didn't have my car while at work, so i always see this place and decided okay why not try it, they do deliver.the food is okay, nothing great about the food. it taste like something i can put together at home. not only that i tried the potato salad and well you can tell it is  completely store bought, wish it  would of been home made, that would of made it so much better. not only that i ordered about 9:45 am and didn't get the delivery till about 11:25 am, i mean they did message me and say they were really busy and they order wouldn't be delivered till 11:00 am, however over all the food is just, well ok",3
"ok....this is the third week in a row i had 3 different technicians come out to my work to change my cracked windshield. this is the third time they've come out to fix it. this time, even before the tech could start, he showed me the glass he was to install is chipped!!!! are you kidding me?!!! why wasn't the glass checked out before he left the warehouse to make sure it was good?? this takes a lot of my time away from my job to escort him & watch them while they work at my job location. i've never had this happen before w\/safellite auto glass & i'm deeply disappointed in all this. talk about frustrating to me, a loyal customer. definitely skeptical on choosing them for future fixes.",2
"i have been sitting here waiting for basic breakfast food for nearly an hour. why am i still here?  well, it's just shy of midnight and i'm hungry!  i want to leave, but i'm afraid my choices at this point are limited and i can't risk having to start waiting all over again somewhere new.  hmmm...just heard the waitress tell the guests at the table near mine that the kitchen messed up their order and asked if the wanted to take the food to go.  i also noticed that one guest at that table had his food while the other waited. they were here before me. did i mention that i'm hungry?  i am starting to wonder if i might die from starvation in an ihop!  i feel like the biggest idiot for sitting here waiting. better be some awesome eggs in my future...",1
"they stop at the upx  cul-de-sac every other week and we look forward to this truck. it's delicious and service is good and it's not outrageously priced like most other trucks. the sister truck, something to do with queso  is also great.",4
"quickies, more later... valentines day weekend, open 9-5p.

these people do a great job! friendly! helpful!",5
a very nice old gourmet restaurant in old st. rose with an eclectic smaller menu cooked and presented in a francais style.  the benefit of this restaurant is the fact that it's bring your own wine!  on this evening my wife ordered a salad and soup and i had the soup and then the lamb. soup was a creme of vegtables with squash and a nice little apple pieces to challenge the pallet!  food was tasteful but my serving of lamb chops was on the smaller side.  quality definitely trumped quantity which is not so bad sometimes!  the meal comes with a nice pita bread with a house made hummus and some other crunch bread!  for desert the choice of creme brûlée which was done very nicely!,4
"in the middle of old montreal, this place has wonderful french food. i had a 7-course meal (from what i remember) and each dish was delicious. dishes were plated really nicely. each dish did not contain huge portions, but was perfect to be able to taste everything and yet be very filling. a bit on the expensive side ($70) but the small quiet place with excellent service made it a worthwhile eat.",5
"my first 5 star rating. 
i can't think of a single area that deserves less. i'm just gonna leave it at that. go try it out and you may be lucky enough to have michael jackson jr. as your guide. yes that's his real name.",5
came here on a sunday. my fiancé said they had the best bloody marys! i got beef brisket. i love how you can choose fatty or lean. i got fatty and it was so tender and juicy. macaroni was also good. i would definitely come here again. staff was friendly too.,4
"the staff is gorgeous, the food is great, pricing is reasonable.  hard to park during xmas season as they are in tempe marketplace, but otherwise, very lively.",4
"what a nightmare dealing with this company!!!
we had several quotes and went with this company because nathan marmon(the owner) seemed very professional and knowledgable when he showed up for the quote. certapro was the most expensive out of all the quotes we received but went with them because we thought we would receive the best service and outcome. oh boy, were we wrong. everything went downhill after i signed the contract. the communication was slow. the property was empty and we gave them a key to access. we were promised a daily update of the painting which never happened. the paint job was shoddy, several places were missed such as the top shelves in the closets were not painted and one side of the door was not painted. the house was left dirty, they ripped my drapery and did not put back hardware they had taken down. on top of that, we had asked for the whole interior of the house painted one color and that was not done. certapro had painted only the walls the color i chose and painted the ceiling, doors and trim the original color. when i contacted them regarding fixing just the ceiling, they wanted and additional $1600 on top of the $3800 original price. they then threatened to put a lien on the house if they were not paid within 20 days after they started the job. i am going to pay them just to get them out of my life but wow, just unbelievable!! never again with this company!",1
kelly was awesome! afterwards she talked to us and answered some questions. she told us to come back and we totally will she was amazing. look forward to going back asap!,5
this place never ever disappoints the tan tan men and champon are hands down my favorite... i always add shrimp to my tan tan men!,5
"enjoyed our stay here. rooms are pretty standard. nothing fancy, but nothing horrible either. my sister in laws room was pretty dirty upon arrival, but ours was fine. worst part was no wifi above the second floor!!! they have an ethernet cord but that didn't help with our iphones and ipads! pool was nice. the area right by entrance was fully shaded in the morning which was perfect for letting my infant swim for a short time. wave pool and lazy river were nice also. the food court is convenient. the buffet was horrible!!  friendly staff. i would stay here again if i wanted something not too expensive.",3
"um, yeah.

so this place has lots of potential...the decor was nice, it was really big, lots of bars to go to, and places to chill and places to dance.  but it was a really bizarre experience.  it was like fraternity party meets bad cheesy wedding.

the dj was just awful,  awful.  maybe he should download better songs from itunes or perhaps try really mixing songs.  during a ""remixed"" song my husband turned to me and said ""wait, maybe he is mixing.""  i looked up and his hands were by his sides.  ""no hun, he just downloaded a remix.""  basically he alternated playing songs that are on my workout mix with standard wedding favorites (she's a brick, houuuuuuse...she's mighty mighty...)  which is fun and all but i wasn't wasted like some of the patrons were.  we got there shortly before 10pm (no cover btw) and there were definitely people way too drunk for that time of night.  i won't lie it was fun watching the drunk girls flop all over the place as its been a long time since i've seen that but i was almost embarrassed for them.  if i have a nickel for everytime i said ""ohhh, and she goes down!"" i may have had enough to buy myself one of their drinks.

which brings me to my next point.  the drinks.  i ordered a mojito martini which tasted exactly like certs that have been sitting in someone's pocket for a week.  it was disgusting.  i drank  3\/4 of it and my husband was surprised i made it that far.  despite the fact that the menu said it was made with 10 cane rum i clearly saw the bartender put bacardi in it.  (there is a huge difference....i feel the way about rum that most people feel about vodka.)  and it was made with mojito mix.  i had no idea there was such a thing.  if there is anything that ticks me off more than bartenders measuring alcohol with a shot glass its drink mixes that can be made yourself.  the drink was so sugary my hands were sticky!  (i hate sticky hands.)  i felt like i put my hands in pancake syrup.  

the crowd was, um, eclectic.  yeah, that's a good word.  i don't understand why you get all dressed up and wear flip flops then i can't understand why you can't keep them on and prefer to  take them off and be barefoot.  ick.  if my hands were that sticky i don't want to think about what the floor was like.  the drunk girls all over the dance floor were amusing, the guy openly humping his lady friend (legs spread eagle and all) at the bar was klassy.  

since it's so close to where we live and so many people seem to like it i'm willing to be cautious here and give it another shot.  these three stars are generous and its just because i feel like this place has so much potential....maybe on a night with a different (real?) dj.   or, maybe the problem was i was driving that night and i wasn't drunk to the point of smacking my friend's ass and falling all over the dance floor.",3
"the worst brownie we have ever tasted in our lives. i brought it home and used it as a sponge to wash the dishes. the girl behind the counter seemed annoyed. ""i have to wait on a customer again?"" was her vibe. i thought nova 's had a great reputation, which is why we stopped in at the central ave. location. never again.",1
sometimes a place suffers from too high expectations.  this was that place for me. the pancakes had a great flavor but everything else was basically dennys. the service was meh. just didn't do it for me especially for the price. just a casino coffee house.,2
"omg, no way will i ever come back to a self service place that charges this much, in this location, almost laughable. i had  to send a tuna sandwich back because i asked for extra lettuce, and they put about 8 shreds on it. when the waitress told the cook to add more, i could hear them, he got defensive, and said he did put extra on it.....omg, would hate to see what the norm is.",3
"this review is solely on the server\/bartender jenna 

i don't want to play the race card but i noticed she paid more attention to her caucasian customers 

-horrible service 
-did not say one word to us but to place our order made no eye contact whatsoever 
-forgot our smoothie we ordered - had to ask another server
-got our order super late
-the caucasian couple next to us that ordered the same thing got their order first when we were there first 
-and got my  order of omelet wrong it was on the menu just plus the sausage -___- 
-asked for our check and gave us attitude saying it was inside a cup in front of us when she never told us the check was there 

still gave her a big tip bless her soul - the rest of the servers seemed nice.",3
"enjoyed a buy-one-get-one from by lovable mad city cocktails book while touring stoughton one weekend morning. deak's menu is nearly identical (the same?) as headquarters in oregon. they must be affiliated. hungover, we went for the bloody marys. unfortunately, deak's bloodies didn't come with the long meat stick like at headquarters, however it was better mixed (i.e. a more balanced blend of tomato, booze, citrus, worcestershire, horseradish - though i'm sure from a mix). we decided to have some late morning chicken strips and waffle fries. the portion was enough for both my partner and i, though we're good at sharing...food. buffalo and ranch on the side. bartender was nice, attentive enough. televisions galore; this would be a good spot to come when the game isn't on your channels.",4
"this staff is friendly and the place is nice and clean but i've had one too many times where the meat was bad right out the of the store. if that wasn't the case, it would be 5 as everything else is great.",3
"i have been a loyal customer for a over a year and if you haven't been, you must go and get naked at naked bbq! everything on the menu is delish! the smoked brisket and pulled pork are legit! it was so tasty that i couldn't resist ordering to-go to share with the family! if you have room and want to satisfy your sweet tooth be sure to order the maple bacon doughnut. amazing! looking forward to my next visit...",5
"i'm not into hotdogs. i'm definitely not into twinkles. 

the twilly dog is a dessert like thing, not the main course hotdog. a hotdog in a twinkie, with peanut butter, & it works. it's good. if you are a health food person like me who prefers the whole foods hot bar over any fast food, just don't think too much about the twilly, get a friend to order it, and take one big middle bite. it will confuse you, because by god it's truly tasty.

if you want a great story of inspiration from the food gods, ask randy how he came up the twilly.

randy, the owner (no, his name isn't willy), greeted us like we just entered his home. his daughter helped us choose the best dogs for our tastes. ask them, take their recommendation. whatever we chose was the best hotdog i've ever had (something with bacon, i don't know), including compared to a chicago dog from a lakeside cart in chicago, and a hotdog off a cart in nyc.  

read the articles on the wall by the door, this guy is passionate about not dogs, and is on a mission of more than food....",5
"worst restaurant in vegas... if only i went to wendy's i would be so much happier which is across the street. i have very low food standards. the burger was black, my girlfriends taco was so dry it was as if she out baby powder in her mouth. honestly i wouldn't go to this place ever again.",1
"for as long as i can remember, aria has been a high class resort and casino on my list ever since it was built. i got a free room through myvegas rewards (minus the cost of resort fees) for one night.  prior to checking in, we decided to drop our bags at the bell desk since we were heading to a day club pool party.  we were intimidated by the long line that had formed outside but the line moved quickly and the bell hops were fast, friendly and efficient! 

checking in through the self-serve kiosk was fast and we had no issues what so ever.  our room was pretty far walk from the elevators as it was located at the very end of the tower.  we were shocked that we were upgraded to a tower king suite which had a guest bathroom, an executive conference room and a very spacious living room\/master bedroom! the showers even had a built in sauna! we were blown away at the amenities and the housekeeper who came in the evening to make our room ready for the evening. she had our bed ready for sleeping, placed slippers next to each side of the bed, organized our stuff in the bathroom, etc.  we definitely felt spoiled and enjoyed our luxurious room. 

we called the next morning and extended our checkout time at no cost.  
tip: aria will charge if you extend your checkout time past 1pm! 

i really liked the fact that their is an employee who only allows guests with room keys access to the guest elevators.  it makes me feel a little more secure! 


overall, love the resort and the friendly, helpful staff on site! it is quite a walk to the center of the strip, but take advantage of the free tram to monte carlo, vdara and bellagio.",5
came in yesterday with a can of paint from 7 years ago.  they matched it perfectly!  customer service was great.  wish i remembered his name.  we will be back.,5
"such a huge fan of this restaurant!  very cute interior -- grabbed seats at the bar.  we were served promptly and the food was awesome!  we were in and out in half an hour.  both of us had salads and they were delicious with the most tasty ingredients.  the goat cheese in my salad was extremely good -- smokey flavour with a good texture.  walnuts, pears, goat cheese and buttermilk dressing on red leaf lettuce.  

my friend had the root salad and it looked really good and she was happy.  we also had some alcoholic beverages that were wonderful.  i also came here previously in june 2011 and was equally as impressed.  the deviled eggs are a definite must and the desserts are to die for.

my only complaint is that they are not open on weekends!",5
"i am a very protective pet owner and i was thrilled with the service i received from lisa and her staff at out-u-go pet sitting. 

they were kind enough to send me daily email updates, clean my cats eye, and consistently put drops in their food. 

i left the country for 17 days knowing that my 3 cats were going to receive the best care around.

they also watered my plants, brought in my mail, and turned on different lights every day. i would recommend them to anyone. they are highly professional but are kind animal lovers too.",5
"eric just left our house for our home warranty call. wasn't sure if i explained everything properly in the request but eric happily took care of it all. he was all business and took care of exactly that! 
thanks for getting our house back in order eric!",5
"so i will start off by saying that i haven't been able to actually eat here because i was too pissed off to sit down. my group of 8 had made reservations for 9:30 and when we arrived they told us it would be another 15 minutes till our table would be ready. reservations are made to ensure you can have a table so being told we had to wait made our mood go down quite quickly. so 15 minutes pass and we check and they completely ignore us until we give them a glare. our 15 minute wait turned into a half hour wait and during that time, groups of people walk out talking about how ""shitty"" the place was. instead of waiting even more for them to get the table ready we decided to eat somewhere else and as we leave the host comes out looking for us as if we weren't mad. i was so happy to try out this place but now i will never go back and i will make sure none of my friends go either.",1
"i had been meaning to try this place and i am so glad that i did!
i loved my grilled chicken taco with guac. the portion was generous and the seasoning was memorable. i eat a lot of chicken tacos so this is saying a lot.
i also had a grilled fish taco and i simply wasn't expecting to be wowed. it was just delicious and again, generous portion, instead of all tortilla and it was cooked perfectly tender, not dry at all. 
the price was reasonable especially for the quality. i think it was $7.xx for the two and i was quite satisfied.
but best of all, on the patio there was this delightful sign reminding us to invite someone to sit at our table. i know i used to be too uncomfortable to do as such, but i truly believe it's just the kind of thing we need more of. 
so i greatly look forward to returning, and sharing a seat!",5
so disappointed to write this review. went to 7 west yesterday with 4 friends. i had 3 beers and the mac and cheese. the mac was very very bland. about 1\/2 through my meal i found a long hair in it :(  i showed it to the server who asked if i wanted a new plate of mac and cheese. i declined. i was quite surprised that there was no offer to comp a beer or dessert or anything. she never mentioned it again. my buddies all had pasta dishes as well. one came out cold and had to be re-heated and 2 of them were bland as well. epic fail for 7 west. none of us will return.,1
"cafe rio- a place i select for lunch\/dinner at least 2x a week. looking for a quick and grab, no hassle meal this is the place to be. they don't have the most locations around town but makes it well worth the drive to find one. i love the variety here; healthy alternatives to a pile of nachos, extra cheese please! i normally get 'everyone's norm' the shredded chicken salad with their cilantro dressing. i'll let you all in one a little secret. get the shredded lettuce vs the normal romaine lettuce they use. it truly makes a difference and you don't have huge pieces of lettuce falling out your mouth. and how did i go so long not trying their tortilla soup!! truly amazing so amazing i'm drooling as i'm thinking about it. 
my current pet peeve about this place..their cilantro. i love cilantro! i just don't like getting the whole branch of the cilantro in my salad or my tacos. help!!",4
"so there's whole thing where you review someplace special for a milestone review, so for my 500th yelp review (wowzers!), i figured a review of my very favorite city would suffice. vegas is not everyone's favorite city. not by a long stretch. but in my purely anecdotal experience, people who tell me they hate vegas are the ones who have only been to the strip. there is so much more to vegas than the strip, y'all. 

i was introduced to vegas at an early age (age 8, to be exact) when my family piled onto an airplane and visited my mom's family-my aunt and uncle had been there for a few years already, and my mimi had just moved there from denver. it was 1996, back in that brief era where vegas tried to market itself as a family-friendly city. we visited the clowns at circus circus, watched the pirates swashbuckle at treasure island, and toured the now-former theme park at mgm grand. i remember sitting on the plane transfixed by the lights as we jetted off into the night. 

that sense of wonder hasn't left, even though it's been a couple decades. i enjoy this city a lot! there's an ocean of good restaurants in all corners of the city, fun activities outside of getting wasted and\/or losing all your money the strip, good shopping, and you're surrounded by some of nature's best offerings. vegas is a great landing spot for those who want to explore more of the mojave. it's even a 5 hour drive from the grand canyon if you're really feeling adventurous. 

but even then, i enjoy the day-to-day in vegas. there's a wonderful little local coffee joint down the street from my mimi's house (desert wind), used book stores scattered around the city when i want to fulfill my collecting whims, more nail salons, spas, etc. you can throw a shoe at, and more. and if you want to shop but don't dare to step foot near the fashion show, summerlin on the west side is where it's at now!

and for those who think there's no cultural heritage here, may i introduce you to the neon museum, the nevada state museum, las vegas art museum, and more? did you know there's even an extensive public library system that was recognized by imls (#saveimls!!) for going above and beyond in meeting the needs of its community when the recession hit vegas pretty hard? 

i recognize this is a city not without problems as no place is perfect; however, there's so many people who assume vegas is the strip and that it's. if you want to be a snob and say vegas is distasteful, too bad for you. you're not doing it right, imho. as for me, vegas is more or less my home away from home, and nothing, not even sordid reputations, will ever take that away from me.",5
"we hadn't been here for quite a while as previous experience was less than wonderful. however heard things are better, so tried it again. steaks are wonderful! jamie was great, the crab was less than superb but she made up for it by a complimentary appetizer card. very pleased to find the quality of the food is back.",5
"amazing...if you like this sort of thing, which we do. if you don't have any interest in the particularly interesting time and place then don't bother. if you're cool you'll love it.",5
"marginal pub food. philly cheese steak with cheese sauce oozed from a gallon jug = yuk!  taco salad was horrible. 

service was good (and the only reason for 2 stars), but the food quality was poor. 

looks like a fine drinking establishment, just eat before you come.",2
"dr druso offers amazing service, and is attentive to your needs. you aren't treated like a number and seen as a another patient towards he end of the day like some other dr offices can be. the front office is also extremely friendly and compassionate, and being that hey are the first person you see when coming in, this make a huge impact on the overall experience. 
   dr druso has helped me through a very difficult time after discovering an old injury in back, and handled all the referrals for the mri and setting a consult with a pain management center, all which have been crucial to my ongoing therapy to treat my condition. she has been my chiropractor for years, and my entire family is seen by her. if you want the personal touch, and family feel at your office visits, and exceptional attention to detail, then call and make an appointment. they take walk ins!",5
fantastic chinese food and large portions!  the best chinese food in pittsburgh!  garlic cucumber and calamari for appetizers are my favorite.  jade grille fried rice and seafood eggplant are excellent!  comfortable bar area for before or after your meal!,5
excellent - food and service - the gobi manchurian is superb - warning if you are a novice eating india - start at 2 or 3 on the spicy scale! they also deliver!,5
"first time here, but food was served cold. had to send soup back to be reheated. fajitas came out warm, but not very hot. rice & beans were luke warm. we will not return.",3
"the first time i had macarons was at ladurée in new york. i didn't know what to expect. here in my hand was a beautiful cookie that i could eat in two bites, and i paid 2.50 for it. five bites later, i was amazed. it had a crisp and fragile outer shell. then soft and chewy with some kind of filling. i was surprised more by the texture than the taste. since then, i have eaten macarons as often as possible. 

so what i'm getting to is that gaby et jules makes the most fantabulous macarons i have tried yet. i got rose, pistachio, peach violet, lemon, lavender and earl grey. the peach violet was my favorite. they were bursting with flavor, and yet not too sweet. and this is coming from a person who can hardly eat anything with sugar in it without calling it too sweet. and they nailed the texture. it was perfect. pro tip: (i'm not a macaron eating pro, i just like to act like i am.) to get the right texture, eat 'em chilled. we got our box of 6, and then walked around in the smoldering remains of squirrel hill for only a brief moment before trying them. still delightful but slightly soggy. the rest were consumed after being in an air conditioned car for awhile. that's when they were perfect. 

there were other pastries sitting on the marble countertops. at least i think they were pastries. they looked like they were made of ceramic, or plastic, or crisco. looked like some kind of art display. so i was afraid to eat any of those because you know what they say, ""you are what you eat."" (don't they say that?) i was afraid if i ate one of those, some art shaped cocoon would suddenly be spun about me and i would be whisked away and hung on a wall. i actually wanted to eat everything. ya, i think i should go back and eat some of those other pastries.",5
"i used to live about two blocks from here. when i first moved there i tried ""create"" burger and it was just about the worst thing i have ever tasted. i got an egg on my burger and that egg must have come from a pterodactyl it was so old. i would often lay in bed at night thinking, ""if only a group of men would come and offer me a tasty burger"" and sure enough baby jesus answered my prayers and five guys came to the rescue. 

i used to live in dc so i was familiar with their work and went there immediately. obviously five guys is a chain but oftentimes chains will have varying degrees of quality- the food is still made by humans(... for now) and so there can be huge differences in quality. this five guys is probably one of the better ones i have been to, i will give a few examples of what i mean

1. online ordering- when i ordered online the first time it said ""your food will be ready in 8 minutes"" - usually a claim like that results in me getting to the place on time and then waiting 20 minutes for my food. not so here- i got there in 7 minutes and by the time i had finished my drink my food was ready. the last thing they did as i was waiting for my bag was fill my cup of fries- and then dump an additional scoop of fries into the bag for no reason other than awesome. 

2. i am waiting in line for my food and i realize due to a miscommunication they have given me a burger with no cheese. i bring this up and they fixed it without charge - and in fact gave me extra cheese. 

3. 300 flavor coke machine.

the burgers are really good for fast food- as are the toppings. they all seem to be freshly prepared- lettuce is crispy, tomato not mushy, jalapeno crisp. i even like the buns.",5
"its like panera, but without the focus on healthy choices or flavor. everything on the menu sounds decent, but nothing has any flavor. as others pointed out, the peppered turkey has no pepper accent whatsoever.

tried the pick two combo- half a sando, half a salad, and a spicy pickle for about $8. gobbler sandwich (peppered turkey, feta, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato mayo) had little to no feta nor artichoke hearts, as i could not detect them at all in the sandwich that i consumed. the parisian salad (grilled chicken, bleu cheese, evoo mayo, avocado, bacon, red onion) sounded tasty, if remarkably unparisian- but it was presented thrown together with minimal toppings, and sided with a huge heap of guacamole, which went with neither dish on the plate? guess they know their food has no flavor, and that must be their attempt to fix it?

service was polite, plate was delivered to my table after ordering, but i was never checked on to ask about the discrepancies with my dishes. manager\/owner appeared to be chatting with friends at the front counter for the duration of my visit, wish she had been more involved in the service- maybe the dishes would have come out correctly.

they do have a yelp check-in offer for free drink\/chips upgrade with your order.",3
"it looks super hip and it should be amazing but the food was just okay. our appetizer was a huge grease fest, we asked if it was supposed to be that way and they took it off our bill but not really ever answered the question. we never got refills on any drinks. they were not that busy either. perhaps we didn't fit their normal crowd of people but i was bummed, it looked fun but i will pass next time.",2
"the service here is the worst. i am extremely disappointed with this location. so dirty, the trash overflowing, every single table was dirty, i can't even describe the bathroom.",1
"revisit today. arrived at 11:40 on a tuesday and two guys were dining. more came later. 

i ordered a bento box with chicken katsu, kailua pork and pineapple chicken. i added a can of soda for $9.47 plus tip. the bento comes with rice and a side, so i chose macaroni salad this time. 

my lunch arrived in about 6 mins. the kailua pork was hot to the point of steamy. the chickens were good, each with its own dipping sauce. 

there was plenty of food to fill up this big guy and i still couldn't finish it.  the chicken was virtually the same for both dishes, just different sauces. the pineapple sauce was so cold and sweet, it went ignored. 

still the best katsu around!",5
"i don't write reviews, but i felt compelled to do so with this establishment. the nigiri sushi was very heavy on the rice and light on the fish.we stayed away from the rolls and stuck with the nigiri sushi. the owner\/chef, noticing us going for the more ""costly"" alternative, decided to load the sushi with an overwhelming amount of rice. it was an obviously underhanded way to get us to order less and get us full faster. do not be fooled by the posted photograph. we've been to many ayce sushi restaurants in las vegas and this by far is the worst. do yourselves a favor and avoid this place like the plague.",1
"definitely my new favorite coffee shop! great location, amazing coffee, friendly service, cute space, and of course gotta love the bikes!! and the smoke sea salt vanilla latte--- come on! delicious!!! :) i will be back!",5
"found enails on google. i came here because the reviews were good. having said that, we all know we shouldn't be live everything we read.

i wasn't disappointed. hannah was my nail technician. she is friendly, talented and gentle. unlike other tech i've had at other salons in the past.
i live quite far away but was in vegas on business. i will only get my nails done here from now on and make it a point to create more reasons to come here if necessary!
if it was possible to give more than 5 stars, this customer would!",5
"so we were driving past and i needed something (not star***ks, not tim h****n's, not a chain) but we were in the sticks..hmm...then i remembered seeing the cute, funky signage and we stopped there. the very patient barista waited while i babbled (incoherently, half asleep) and i ended up w a tasty earl grey almond milk latte and a fantastic matcha, white chocolate scone (trust me, totally not a white or milk chocolate fan). almost didn't get the scone, but am all about anything matcha. so glad i did. not too sweet, tastes like it's made with quality ingredients. latte i added a tiny bit of cinnamon and it was great. quite pleased, would go back.",4
"server messed up entire order, food wasn't that great and it took forever. probably my last time coming to this location.",1
"the original roofing company met a few challenges as they planned, staffed, and completed my roofing job. the work is spot on, and any issues i am sure will be taken care of as professionally as they handled my project. in today's construction workplace specialty contractors must meet daily staffing challenges, they must deal with unknowns, and they are charged with pleasing the client. 

i am happy to say that the original roofing company did what every contractor should do, and performed their contract. hat's off to toni lumpkin for outstanding customer service, and help along the way.",5
"the place itself isn't very clean & i had the impression this was a healthy spot..up until i saw them make a smoothie & pour in like 4 packets of sugar in it. no thank you! so make sure you request for no sugar to be added to your smoothies. 

i don't think i will be returning to this location but i am going to give tropical smoothie another chance and see how clean another location is. 

the big winner for me is that they give 50% off to military, police officers & fire fighters. it's nice to see a business show some real support to those that keep us safe.",3
"i love this store. great prices, fresh food, and lots of options. they have great meals that are ready to cook. if you're looking for dinner or just for ideas, come here! 
more affordable than sprouts and whole foods. the staff is friendly and helpful. i love coming here a few times a week. also, they are open 24 hours!  
definitely check them out!",5
"i wasn't too thrilled about the standard rooms in this hotel.  it was fairly small to really walk back and forth from the entrance of the room to the bed and imagine a room with 4 people! pretty tight i'd say...

from what i see, it looks like the rooms may have been remodeled? it's been 3 years from the last time i stayed there and all i can say is that i didn't really enjoy it.",2
"went here to have my nails done.  first of all, i can't tell if they even grasp what i want because they can't speak very good english, and mostly respond with ""yeah, yeah,yeah"".  next i come here and i'm the only customer.  i get the one named hy who obviously has poor artistic skills.  i wouldn't have this guy pain the side of my house!  i ended up with a nail polish job that looked like a 4 yr old did it when they were drunk.  i complained to the guy while he was doing it, and his solution was to add more coats of polish!  my nails ended up looking like i dipped my fingers in pink hot wax.  i told three employees i hated it but got nowhere.  finally i paid and hy had the gall to ask if i wanted to add a tip.  i walked out, but just couldn't accept the shoddy work and went back in.  henry got attitude and abruptly told me to sit down and wait my turn (now 8 people waiting) to have them fixed.  totally disappointed, spent almost 3 hours on that should have only taken an hour at the most! i'm irritated with oriental attitude!",1
"great fish selection, knowledgeable wait staff.  menu is varied with appetizers, soups, sandwiches, salads, steaks, and fish.  great side selection that goes beyond the typical potatoes, including honey carrots, brussel sprouts, and couscous.  easily would appeal to a diverse crowd.  will definitely come back.",4
"arriving to cleveland late, and staying at a nearby hotel... this is a great option to grab dinner.

i had a jalapeño burger (of sorts), it was not spicy or filled with deep flavor.. but it was a solid burger.  there was breaded jalapeño poppers - not 100% sure on those...they were pretty mushy and without flavor.

the burger came with fries, lots of fries (like 70% of your plate will be covered)...  if you like fries, you will love these deep fried fries.

they also have a nice selection of local & national beers, liquors, and mixers! 

it's solid bar n grill ..  enjoy!",4
"used to be 5 star and has definitely dropped in quality and customer service. the guy who is always at the register and makes the boba drinks is kind of rude and doesn't smile at all anymore. the meat has been poor quality recently as well. didn't have this problem before, it's obvious the quality is cheaper.",2
"this shop is my spot!!! i've been getting my haircuts from laz for the past few years and i've never had a complaint. glad he got his own barber shop, the staff is always in a good mood and very friendly even if i don't get my cuts from them. bring your own movies tho! laz has the movie major payne playing in repeat all day everyday lol",5
"this review is for 3.5 stars. 

wendy's was a tough review. i really wanted to give it 4 stars because a few of the dishes i ordered were quite good, but in general the full meals just didn't have enough variety in them. the basis of each dish was great, but didn't really constitute a dish in my mind, just a good piece of food. for instance, the bbq pork was some of the best in the city and pretty cheap for under $7, but it came pretty dryly marinated and on a bed of rice, with only a few small pieces of chinese broccoli on the side. the egg noodles were fantastic as well, but didn't have many vegetables or protein, so although the noodles tasted great (hence the restaurant's name) the dish didn't compare. i need to check back and see if they have a lunch special where it's more 1-2 ingredient based rather than dinner where i expect more. prices are reasonable too. i would recommend wendy's, but order some side dishes to accompany the main food on your plate.",3
"great food and service was above average. 

this place serves tapas style. so slightly expensive for somewhat small portion.

only thing that was bad was that they ran out most of the food that i've ordered.",4
"only place i will trust with special cakes! i've ordered multiple cakes from them over the last 8 years and never once had an issue with decoration or design not being exactly what i was looking for. the consultation is very easy and consultants always friendly and genuinely care about your occasion and what you are trying to accomplish. my final comments ""icing on the cake"" hahahaha would be that after a detailed and very easy ordering and pickup process; the quality and flavor in each of the cakes i have ever ordered has been by far the best tasting cakes anyone i know has ever had! they are amazing and i would recommend them to everyone!",5
"love it here! great food, great service!  i usually get the house special and it always comes out hot and yummy. spring rolls are amazing here. probably the best i've had. 

best pho place in brampton.",5
"yes, this is my ring! i have never been so excited to see the final ring. it was exactly what i wanted and more. i actually cried when i put it on as it is a beautiful symble of our love of 43 years. my husband always had beautiful writing and my name is in his actual hand writing which was taken from a neckace he gave me when we were 16 years old. the front said i will love you forever and he engraved my name on back. found this in his garage after he had passed. he kept it hanging in his garage. so having my name in his handwriting just means so much. i just dont knw how to thank kim and jake. it just feels like i am holding him in my hands forever. thank you so much for your personal touch and feeling in helping me design!! 5 star buisness!!!!!! love you guys!!!",5
"i came to noodle asia originally just to meet some drunk friends before we went up to the room.  while one of my inebriated friends was yacking in the bathroom conveniently located right outside the restaurant, i decided that his almost untouched rice plate should not go to waste...

so i finished it...

and it was good!!! 

then i ate some kind of pan fried noodle plate and drank a bunch of the soup they ordered.  i have no clue what food my friends got, but i remember that it was all really good.

4 stars for good grub, awesome location, and the staff letting me just walk up in there and eat all my friends' food.",4
"i am so confused by the reviews for union pig & chicken.  so so confused.  maybe when they're crowded this place gets crazy, but my friend and i came in the first time on a friday for lunch and were the only people by the end of our meal.  we loved it, and we've been back multiple times since!  the bar upstairs' service is soooo slow and practically non-existent.  but the communal tables downstairs usually have great service.

first, our server our first trip made the experience.  i wish i could remember her name because she was awesome.  she was from texas, and she had gone to school for art and did some singing.  girl needs a promotion because she was one of the best servers i've ever had.  we've had one other server who was really cool as well.  very friendly.

union pig & chicken has a lunch special where you can get one of the sandwiches with a drink and side for the same price as just the sandwich.  obviously a steal.  i got the shrimp po bo sandwich ($12), and it was so tasty.  i cannot wait to go have another.  my friend and i split the mac and cheese side ($4) which was fanstastic.  it was super cheesey, and the portion was huge.  i could have eaten just that for a meal and been happy.  we also tried the cornbread ($3) and coleslaw ($4).  my cornbread was crazy buttery and not dry at all, but the piece was really small.  the coleslaw was good but it had onions.  blergh.  the sweet tea that came with my meal was great too.

the meaty mac ($9) is delicious as well.  it was different but delicious.  however, if you take it home, eat it quickly!  the taste keeps getting stronger and stronger as it sits longer.

the atmosphere is weird.  the ground floor is half surrounded by glass windows and half really dark, and there are communal tables.  there is also a bar area upstairs.  the communal tables would be fun with more people around.

my friend and i keep planning to come in and try the drink specials.  the lunch deal is great, and i think it's a steal for the quality of the food.  i think the dinner rates are a bit overpriced, but nowhere is perfect.",4
"this is a small family run restaurant with super friendly service and phenomenal food at a very affordable price. the only down side is that they only have a few small tables for customers to sit so it's not great for a large group. a lot of people seem to order for take-out.

the chef\/owner (james) was friendly; came out to chat with us. he seemed to  take great pride in everything he makes. all the deli meats are cured, smoked and prepared in house. everything is freshly made from scratch including the bread, fries, salad dressing and dipping sauce. 
i had the pastrami sandwich with fries, coleslaw and pickles. pastrami was to die for; very moist and good flavour. freshly cut fries seasoned with sea salt were so good. portion was generous. you can substitute fries for salad if desired.
we also ordered a side of hickory smoked bacon. i looooved the bacon. it was cured and smoked in house!!! i finished the last slice and still desired more even though i was so stuffed from the pastrami.

we got some butter tart squares to go and they were delish. the crust was yummy and buttery. 

overall, we had a great experience and will come back to try other items on the menu.",5
"i have never liked yoga...ever. it was too fast, too hard, i couldn't reach anything i was supposed to be able to reach, and i never learned anything.
enter yoga hive. with a $10 for 2 weeks intro deal and it's location literally a hop and a skip from desk at pgc, i had no reason not to try it out with my yoga initiated coworkers. and what follows is simply a love story.
all the instructors there are wonderful but by virtue of her teaching schedule with my schedule, i have taken the most classes from and the greatest affinity for the owner kimberly.  i am not exaggerating when i say i owe my new found love of yoga to her open, welcoming and supportive spirit.
i have learned so much at the yoga hive- that i can go at my own pace because speed is not the goal, that i can modify poses to make them work for my body so a deep stretch does not cross the line to painful, that i can further modify poses so that i can reach what i never could before. but most importantly i learned to breathe, to be patient with myself and to celebrate the little victories as they come.  i still get frustrated because i am human but i know that whenever i doubt myself that kimberly, lauren, meg, cherilyn, etc believe in me and know that i can do whatever it is that's in front of me, and then i do.
i have never found a place to workout that is as warm (figuratively and literally), welcoming, effective and rejuvenating as the yoga hive.
you must go, even if you don't think yoga is for you, the yoga hive is.",5
"very cool location by the harbourfront which was convenient after watching a jays game (though we left the game as soon as we could to head over here to ensure we got a good spot!). chose a section that had a spectacular view of the water and was kind of outside (but not really?) and since the weather was still cool that day, finding fleece blankets in our seats to use was a welcome sight. it felt very cozy actually and was an interesting way to indulge in some food and beer.",4
"is this place a world wonder? or was it created by an act of god? was it an offspring of a latina and an asian? maybe it was a miracle of science? it most likely happened when they put a panda in a fusing machine with a burrito and thus the restaurant chino bandido was created. however the restaurant was created, it has some of the most unique food i ever had. the restaurant is a fuse of mexican cuisines and asian flavors and a lot of creativity to make a unique menu.

if it is your first time at the place or you want to try something new on the menu, i would suggest asking for a sample of some of their dishes. once you figure out which ones are your favorites, you have the next hard task of figuring out whether you want it on a dish, in a burrito, or a quesadilla. all of these choices give you reason to come back several times over to try out something new each time and you can't do it in one sitting because the amount they give you is quite filling.

also makes sure to take a picture of the panda in sombrero with the awesome mustache or selfie with it.",4
"the food is so greasy, the meat all wallowing in fat and oil. we celebrated a  reunion in this place and at least 6-7 people in our group suffered stomach upset. the room is dingy and not very clean. the only positive is that they gave us an extra 30 mins. free. will not recommend.",2
"this place is amazing! it is a fast food but the quality is way better than other greek fast food chains. i got the chicken gyro dinner and my husband got the pork gyro in pita. the chicken was very tasty. the side of roasted potatoes had an orange-colored sauce and were cooked perfectly. they drizzle the sauce on the rice as well. the salad that came with the dinner had a generous amount of feta unlike other fast food chains. the pork gyro was well-seasoned with fries inside the pita. the spicy tahini provided a great kick. we were so satisfied that we took some stuff home for our 2 teenagers and they loved the food as well. we will be back, that's for sure!",4

"this place is just okay. we sat at the bar and the bartender was great!  food, however, mediocre. decent bar food.",3
the happy hour is great!  all appetizers $10 and under and all cocktails are half off.  the tuna tartare and shrimp tacos are the best! the jalapeño margarita is a great cocktail!,5
"my husband and i ordered food for delivery tonight. he got the mild wings, but they were so hot he couldn't even swallow the 1 bite he took. he spit it out and had to drink a glass of milk to cool his mouth down a little. he also got a cheese burger and he only ate half because it was over cooked. then there was my food. i got the chicken street tacos that the chicken was great, but i could not eat the soft taco shell because it tasted fishy. yeah fishy, i didn't understand that either. the chicken was good though. i also got the spicy chicken flatbread. that might be really good, but i could not taste anything besides my tongue burning. for that i cannot complain to much because some people love the heat, i am just not one of those people. we ordered the sweet potato fries to share, and those were just nasty. i will not say what it tasted like, but i had to spit it out because it was so horrible. so tonight i spent almost $55 for nothing. maybe other people love the food, but it is not what my husband and i liked at all.",2
"very interesting combination of food under one establishment. this restaurant offers chinese and mexican fusion eats, both available at one location...

we decided to give this place a try since we are staying at the cosmo and wanted to find something within the hotel. the front of the restaurant has a very eclectic vibe with many different colors and chinese\/mexican heritage decor throughout. i love all the loud colors from the exterior, and inviting decor. 

the hostess at the entrance was nice and got us seated right away. our server theron, was on point on providing special recommendations. the food is definitely an acquired taste. don't come in thinking that the food found here is what you'll find in some fast food because it's not anything found in fast food places. the food here definitely has a fusion kick being that the food is definitely in the fancier side, than normal. 

the plates are on the smaller side, so the idea of this restaurant is more tapas and family style. the idea is to order multiple dishes that you can share with amongst everyone on the table. all in all after ordering 5 dishes with 3 alcoholic beverages of bill was just about less than $100. 

would i recommend it for friends to try? let's just say i'm not rushing to tell my friends about this foodie experience. customer service is great, but i think the food is too fancy for me, when all that i want after day drinking is a greasy taco or bowl of shrimp fried rice.",3
this place is my favorite place to eat anytime of the day. i eat here often so i've tried pretty much everything from breakfast with a begium waffle topped with fresh sweet strawberries and whipped cream to a beautifully​ cooked juicy ribeye steak with eggs.  dinner is when i go most often to eat a fresh spinach or caesar salad with shrimp and chicken or the spaghetti and meatballs.  you can also never go wrong with the prime rib special for $10.95. the staff is always friendly and seat me right away. the atmosphere is very relaxing and the vintage decor and old time movie playing on the tv's is a real nice touch. i highly recommend siegel's 1941 to anyone visiting las vegas. if you love downtown vegas make sure you stop in for a delicious meal and an old fashioned​ ice cream sundae. you won't be disappointed.,5
awsome food!!! i could eat one of each little empanadas.  they have multiple flavor options.  the services is not bad.  the place is chic.  and the location is not in a plaza or at a main streets but it in a good location.,4
this restaurant was a recommendation by another restaurant that was booked - which was lovely of them to share. try the wings! the green tea ice cream! the octopus was pretty good but a tad bit over cooked - a most common thing. still - it was not rubber like is often the case! the space is beautiful and the wait staff was delightful. oh! and the spicy edamame was delish too! it is quiet enough that you can have a conversation and while it is listed as vietnamese - it was more like asian fusion to my way of thinking. a very lovely evening.,4
"more like 2 1\/2 stars. most of the doctors are skilled and competent, and interactions with my regular pediatrician have been positive. so where do they go wrong?

1. booking appointments on the phone. you might be on hold for 40 minutes to talk to someone, but the alternative is leaving a message (which they won't return, or at least not within a week, anyway).
2. based on #1, by the time you get an actual appointment booked, it will be too late. i called to make a newborn appointment for my daughter when she was less than 2 weeks old, and by the time they called back and my doctor was available, it was over a month away. so much for the ""newborn"" appointment. thank god i had my midwife who was able to follow up with the baby's growth and feeding.
3. front desk staff are rude and were not hired for their people skills.
4. if you sign up for the online booking system for $13\/yr, which i suggest you do (see #1 and #2), there's no guarantee they'll honour your appointment time. i signed my sick son up for an appointment the next morning at 9:40 with another doctor, and by the time i was seen, it was three hours past my scheduled appointment. i waited three hours with my miserable child in a crowded and worn waiting room. i'm wondering why i bothered making an appointment at all, at that point? note: the online system is void if your child has not been seen by a doctor there yet. there will be a long, long delay getting said patient into the system (see #1 and #2).

i know this is quebec so we have to work within the confines of the resources available. if you can find a good doctor at the clinic (which there are many, especially women doctors) and don't mind putting up with all of the frustrating baggage dealing with this clinic, then you will probably receive decent care at tiny tots.",3
"in spite of the praise being doled out by fellow yelpers, i found my experience at bangkok garden underwhelming. to be sure: the service is great and the atmosphere is grand and regal, but the food left much to be desired. my pad thai (the standard by which i measure all restaurants thai) was low on flavour and the chicken and shrimp were overcooked. my date's dish (a veggie summerlicious offering) wasn't much better. for gourmet thai, i wasn't impressed, especially considering the steep price tag.

obligatory title pun: not a lot of bang for your buck.

menu readability: good. there are lot of offerings, and everything is clearly laid out and well-described.

need to mention: it's a lousy sign when you're both rolling pieces of deep fried soy in your mouth wondering what that weird taste is.

what this place teaches me about myself: i can't not order pad thai at a thai restaurant. it's my crutch.",2
"are they fake or are they real?

when you have a drink named after one of man's most pondered questions and it happens to be one of the most asked questions at this particular bar... you know you made the right decision to bypass hooters and check out this hidden attraction out.

 i have faded memories of coming to the moon for a friend's birthday party once before but most recently, a group of friends and i stopped by after a spring training game. our first stop had been salty's for their happy hour, after a while you realize it's just not worth the hassle. so we headed on over to the moon....

hands down better service, better food, and a better crowd! 

they just so happened to have rugby on a couple of tvs when we walked in so i knew right away we were in the right spot. drinks all around for our part of 6, a big plate of nachos and who knows how many wings later, everyone was satisfied! considering we were not on happy hour pricing the bill was still decent for what we ordered and we never had to wait for a drink. i'll be back!",5

the best place to see the show...and catch the cheesy beads... is on the second level... sit down, have a drink, lots of cafe's (inexpensive)

we didn't stay here so i can't comment on hotel. but the show is a huge production done many times throughout the day and so worth a visit, check the internet for times.",5
"catfish and red beans and rice. i have had a lot of fried catfish and this is great because it's lightly dusted in cornmeal so you can taste the fish. red beans and rice, i'm no expert, but i thought it was great. friendly quick service and a really nice clean new looking place.",5
"our favorite, go to, restaurant. whether we are starving or entertaining visitors or having the best cocktails during the happy hour...must have: french fries with 3 sauces, ribs, fabulous salads and daily specials.  the wait staff are attentive and friendly, crazy winter crowds or summer slow season, they take special care of each customer.",5
"definitely one of the better burritos i've ever had. can be pretty pricey to be honest, but worth it since they're extremely generous with their portions and you are one full baby after eating a meal. their dishes do tend to taste similar so i wouldn't go too often but every couple of weeks definitely hits the spot. a+ guys",4

"this is my favorite thai restaurant (and in my general top 10) on the planet. the spicy basil noodles are to die for. when i'm back in the 412, i eat here twice a week.

it's very cozy inside, and while there could be table cloths and more stuff on the walls, i never mind. you can't find a better cooked thai meal, and amazingly enough for that trait, a cheaper one. 

i crave this stuff often.",5

"wow, i don't know about the other reviews but this place was awesome. 
there were two cooks on a monday night and the soup and salad were good while we waited, which wasn't long. i don't remember our cooks name but he's from columbia and he was great! he had personality and he had charm and a little pizazz to the presentation. me and the bf each had cocktails and yakitori. i ordered the filet mignon and he had the ny steak. the rice was great, the meat... each little piece was a pice of heaven. originally the cook gave us two sauces but during our conversaion he gave us a third very very spicy sauce which to say at this moment as i'm yelpin. well the spice danced on my tongue and laughed at me as i gulped down water. but i loved it. and now..i could some milk :)
the place is kinda of small and can see that if they were busy how it might taint the experience. so go on a monday~ 
also the decor wasn't bad either with the dark wooden art pieces, dark framed mirrors and big red hanging ball lights.
bottom line :  small, good and unique.",5

"first time here and it was surprisingly what we were looking for, for tonight's dinner.  a couple of suggestions though.  the starters were definitely not what i was expecting.  we had the crispy octopus and 1\/2 a dozen oysters (west coast).  the oysters had so much shells from shucking that i was scared to have more than 1.  sauces cost extra so just be aware.  the crispy octopus was a little bit my taste; but there was something in it that i bit into that had this disgusting bitter taste and killed the whole plate for me.  again this may just be a one time thing so please don't be afraid to try those dishes because they are phenomenal.  now let's get to the good part of this review.  being that i'm cambodian i had to try the jerk chicken because the dish came with papaya salad and my family always love to try new styles of papaya salad.  oh my goodness.  it was amazing.  i have nothing bad to say.  the tenderness of the chicken and the spice from the papaya salad made me feel like i was eating my grandma's cooking and we all know grandma's cooking is the best.  my friend had the salmon which is another must try.  i only had a few bites so i wouldn't be able to tell you what the full flavor profile of the plate was; but i can tell you that we almost licked our plate clean.  service was amazing.  she was attentive and kind and gave us enough space to enjoy our dinner without feeling like she was on us.  great job with this one.  definitely coming back for more!",4
"do not order from pumpernickle's for catering. do not order from pumpernickle's for your office functions. do not order from pumpernickle's for guests.

why does anyone order, and expect, from a catering service?

convenience
good food
saving time
customer service

they have set up their system so it suits them and not their customer. they sat down and figured what they need and how they would be happy and how they incompetently would profit. that is the entirety of their process.

first, we would have saved time if i had made sandwiches and cold pasta at home the night before or morning of and brought it with me for our function.
second, the el...something person had a bad phone, which she blamed on my colleague. according to this employee of theirs who answers their corporate number, the line she used which constantly cut out as though she had second calls coming in, was our company's fault. she also sounded like dealing with my coworker was a hassle she didn't need. then they charged us twice. once from corporate and once from the local business near our offices. when my coworker called them and asked they told us that 'this is how we do it' (i told you their process is what works for them). should they have warned us in advance (never mind that they should stop this practice!)? well, not according to them, they don't care. 
explanation? nah, why give that to customers? 
why did you charge us twice? it is a hold. 
why do you put x 2 holds on a credit card?? are you not one company? it will get removed!
why do we have to call you several times and why could you not tell a customer this before (not to mention a second hold - never mind a hold - is not required in the first place)? oh well.. yeah... that is how we do it! 
could you reverse it? your bank will do it! 
when? call your bank, i don't know!!

you see how much a waste of time these people are?

food? average.
quantity? average?

there are a million catering businesses out there and many of them are grateful, polite and save you time too! pumpernickle is not into those concepts.",1
"my wife and i live in goodyear, and we decided to drive up and check out archie's on the recommendation of a friend.  we have lived in the valley for about 3 years, and i have become a fan of the downtown deli in downtown phoenix, which was actually the first corned beef and pastrami i had ever had.

to me, this place was ok, but in comparison to downtown deli, it was quite lacking in value and taste.  i got a double jeopardy on an onion roll, which is corned beef, pastrami, hot and regular mustard, as well as swiss and muenster cheese.

upon taking the first bite, i knew something was missing.  the taste just didn't seem to be there.  i couldn't taste much mustard at all (there was very little on the sandwich), and the meet was not as i have become a fan of.  i am used to good corned beef and pastrami melting in your mouth, and this definitely did not do that.  even after putting the hebrew national deli mustard on the sandwich, it seemed a bit bland.

now, i'm saying it was ""bad"" necessarily, maybe i have become spoiled by downtown deli.  but for the $35 we spent (just meals for my wife and i plus tip, the kids eat free after 4), i wasn't impressed.  i think the pricing was a little bit much, $2-3 cheaper would have been more reasonable.  especially with the quantity of the sides.  we both got potato salad, and is was served in a small plastic cup like you would get your fruit in at and elementary school (see the picture of the applesauce).  for $11.50 (for my sandwich), that's just not enough.",2
"the taco al pastor was highlighted as the star item on the menu and so we gave it a go. it is pork taco sauteed with pineapple. for almost $10 it came with 5 miniature tacos with a slice of lime. the taste, however was very familiar to me as it taste like bland asian home cooking. 

we also ordered the spicy chicken tinga taco were slightly better as the meat was tender and seasoned well. with tips and tax we put down $26 and walked away still very hungry. 

question: does good mexican food exists in toronto?",2
"this is a great restaurant for a date night.

when my wife and i came in, we enjoyed the duck, the calamari, and a bacon cheeseburger.  odd combination, but all great.  nothing was spectacular, but all of it was definitely tasty.  

keep in mind the entrees have a pretty wide price range, from about $10 to almost $40.

this is not a great restaurant for brunch, if our recent experience is any indication.  

we came in with a large group, but there was no one in the restaurant at the time so that shouldn't have been an issue.  they were out of pancake toppings, pancake mix, and avocados.  after we were waiting for our food for a really long time, the general manager came out to explain they had had to go to trader joe's to get tortillas (they ran out of those, too).  the food, when it came, was fine.  again, nothing was spectacular, though the rolls they bring out before the entrees arrive are really tasty.  

overall i would recommend bink's midtown over bink's scottsdale due to their amazing patio, but if you're in this area and want something a bit more private, this is a good choice.",3
"came here on a girl's night out with my sister, and we adored the place!! i was feeling a little under the weather, so chose not to order anything too strong in flavour (curries, spicy soups, etc.). i therefore chose the steamed chicken momos, while my sister ordered the goat curry with a side of steamed basmati rice.

i loved my momos! the inside meat was seasoned perfectly, with a slight but not overwhelming touch of curry flavour. the garlic sauce was absolutely delicious and fragrant. 

my sister's goat curry was also very good! it was unlike the curry we're typically used to in that it had a more sour taste with yogurt. there were generous chunks of goat, and so much food in general that we ended up taking it home.

will come again! very rarely can we find authentic nepalese food in the mississauga region.",4
"more like hash house a no no! for dinner at least...

sure, if you're looking to pick up a few rosemary trees this is the place for you. never in my life have i seen an 8 inch log of rosemary used as a decorating piece in my food. ya, definitely not getting that one chef. 

my wife wanted to order hash, which is why we went to hash house a go-go, as hash is traditionally served with poached eggs, and they only serve it with scrambled eggs with dinner. whaaaa? so it's okay to have poached eggs for breakfast but not for dinner.  hmmph. 

i had the chicken and biscuits. the gravy was schmeh. yep, just schmeh. the chicken was tougher than a boiled owl. the asparegus was so tough that i couldn't even cut it with a steak knife. the only good thing about the meal were the biscuits. they were very good.

one of the more disappointing dining experiences i've had in a while. with so much talk about how amazing this place was i expected a lot more. not a very value friendly place either. 

no no for the go go.",2

"staples.com listed the ipad mini 2 as being in stock at this location.  it offered same day pickup.  i chose to just drive to the store and buy it. they had one, rang it up, but when i asked them to match their own price online they said they couldn't.  they said they could order online and have it at the store by monday (2 days).  they said this literally while they were holding one in their hand.  even though their website said one was in stock at their store and was available for same day pick up!  and they were holding one right in front of me!  they said the online deals come from a different inventory.  so frustrating!  i swear everytime i try a brick and mortar rather than amazon i experience the same stupidity.  

tl;dr:  i tried to buy something from staples but they were too stupid to take my money.",1
"deceptively delicious!  this interesting little place looks like an off brand drive thru coffee shop at first glance, but oh no!! when you go in (bike and pet friendly) you find a great outdoor dining space small bar and a small dining room.  the sandwiches and salads are amazing. eclectic crowd, interesting decor. think hipster cool. enjoy!",4

"allgemein
je grauer der schmuddelwinter, desto größer die sehnsucht nach mediterranem - für uns ein grund für einen ausflug in griechische gefilde, diesmal ins porto eliá, gelegen in einem cannstadter wohngebiet unweit der s-bahn-station nürnberger straße.  wir betreten das restaurant an einem freitagabend durch einen windfang, es ist es um acht uhr schon recht voll, aber wir haben reserviert und bekommen einen tisch am ende des l-förmigen raumes. kurze zeit darauf auch die speisekarte, die mit der auf der webseite identisch ist.
 
ein blick umher überrascht uns ausgesprochen positiv, das nicht besonders große restaurant ist außergewöhnlich schön gestaltet, es dominiert die farbe weiß (wände, stofftischdecken, weißgestrichene holzstühle mit strohsitz) unterbrochen von lindgrünen akzenten, dekoriert sind die wände mit elegant ausgeleuchteten regalen mit öl- und weinflaschen, es fehlt jeglicher folklorekitsch. die beleuchtung durch die regale, dezente deckenleuchten aus weidengeflecht und kerzen ist ungeheuer angenehm, nicht zu hell, nicht zu dunkel, blendfrei und harmonisch.
 
wir entspannen also beim blick in die karten und entscheiden uns vorneweg für die mezedes zesta, die gemischte vorspeisenplatte (€ 12,40), danach möchte mein mann die platte porto eliá (souvlaki, hähnchenbrustspieß, lammkotelett, bauernbratwurst, € 16,90) und ich den tintenfisch vom grill, gefüllt mit paprika und getrockneten tomaten aus santorini (€ 14,40), dazu griechische backofenkartoffeln und gemischtes gemüse (auf der karte ausgewiesen zu je € 3,50, wurde aber nicht berechnet).  an getränken möchten wir einen sauvignon blanc (€ 5,30), einen ampeloeis silver (cabernet sauvignon und merlot, € 6,30) und ein großes wasser (€ 4,40). als nach einiger zeit der freundliche kellner kommt, um die bestellung aufzunehmen, läßt mein mann sich noch einen aperitif des hauses empfehlen. bei der vorspeisenplatte, so der weitere rat, reicht die version für eine person, wenn man anschließend noch ein hauptgereicht essen möchte. dankeschön, so machen wir das - mit einer ausnahme: eingedenk der erfahrung, daß das essen in den meisten mediterranen lokalen kommt, bevor man den apertif ausgetrunken hat, bleibe ich lieber nur beim wein.
 
meine entscheidung entpuppt sich als mehr als weise, denn ein paar minuten später kommt das essen vor den getränken. vor uns aufgebaut werden vier schöne rechteckige schälchen, darauf befinden sich nett angerichtet vier scheiben auberginen im backteig mit tsatsiki, kartoffelcreme, verschiedene joghurt-feta-cremes, eine mit fetacreme gefüllte dünne lange paprika und drei gefüllte weinblätter mit tsatsiki. kurz darauf kommen dann auch die getränke, der spezial-aperitif schmeckt recht fruchtig, mein sauvignon gut. das mineralwasser ist ein griechischer import in einer schönen dunkelblauen flasche.
 
wir haben hunger und greifen zu, ganz einfach ist das allerdings nicht, denn wir haben nur unsere messer und gabeln, servierlöffel oder ähnliches ist nicht vorgesehen. geschmacklich ist es nicht schlecht, aber wenig abwechslungsreich und ein bißchen fad, die auberginen sehr fettig. für das, was griechische restaurants in dieser kategorie gewöhnlich auffahren, bleibt das gebotene sehr blaß.
 
blaß bleibt auch der service, denn der läßt uns jetzt vor den leeren tellern sitzen. und sitzen und sitzen. irgendwann gelingt es uns, den offenbar nur zum auf- und abtragen engagierten hilfskellner zu kapern, der dann auch freundlich die servierplatten abräumt und die teller stehenläßt. auf erneute aufforderung beim nächsten vorbeikommen werden sie dann endlich mitgenommen. und wir warten weiter, mein mann nicht nur auf das essen sondern auch auf seinen rotwein. leider kann der hilfskellner nur wenig deutsch und deshalb diesem wunsch nicht entsprechen, immerhin zeigt sich dann auch wieder der kellner vom anfang, und so kommt der wein dann praktisch zeitgleich mit dem essen.
 
vor meinem mann türmt sich eine ansprechend aufeinandergestapelte fleischpyramide, daneben die kartoffeln, vor mir erscheint ein großer sepia mit deutlichen röstspuren, umgeben von paprika- und zucchiniwürfeln. ich beginne mit nachdruck zu säbeln, denn der tintenfisch ist hart am gummitier  und die flügel verbrannt. das beilagengemüse hätte auch noch einen tacken länger gegart werden können. geschmacklich ist alles sehr mittelprächtig, die füllung aus fetacreme mit paprika und tomaten wirkt, als hätte man die paprika von der vorspeisenplatte im tintenfisch untergebracht. irgendwann wird es mir zu mühsam und ich lasse ein drittel liegen.
 
mein mann kämpft noch tapfer mit seinem fleischberg, während ich noch seine kartoffeln probiere. die sind unverständlicherweise matschig (wie kriegt man backofenkartoffeln matschig?) und schmecken auch nicht berauschend. wir werfen neidische blicke zu der gutgelaunten griechischen herrenrunde am nebentisch, die mit ihrem essen sehr viel zufriedener scheint.
 
nun tritt aber dafür der kellner wieder auf und bietet ...",4
"i visited for my first time friday with my godchild. the host was engaging, friendly, professional and serviced in the short absence of our attending server. the servers were pleasant, knew the menu and were most accommodating. i enjoyed the meal and service so much, i brought other family members the next day. good job,  i was impressed.",4
"we moved to the atwood area about a year ago, and have visited wongs several times. it does not have an ambiance to write home about, but the food has been consistently good: flavorful, not greasy and very reasonable portions and prices. the owners\/staff are all very nice and friendly too. 
its not a place to bring a hot date, but for a nice quick meal its a great spot.",4

there's so much i can say about this hotel. my stay just seems to get better and better by the day. seen about 2 ref's since there's a ufc fight tonight and that was just in the matter of 10 seconds. can imagine who else i'd see if i wasn't at the door of my hotel. room service is super friendly and there's no need to ask for anything really. i had a roll of tissue by the bed and they replaced it with a box of tissue. now in house dinning is expensive but the food is really good especially if u don't feel like leaving the hotel. gave it 4 stars because of the in house dinning other than that it can most def be a 5 star.,4

"artist at work! 

by far one of the highest quality barbers in all of az. if you're looking for someone true to their craft and that takes pride in styling you correctly as a representation of their art come here! if you're going to walk in and ask for a 2 on the side and a 3 on top then please continue to go to your normal shop and enjoy the lollipop they give you for sitting through the entire hair cut. that may be harsh but it's to emphasize how to truly appreciate the quality of care you're getting here. yes a proper barber cut will take time this is no 15 minute stop by any means. however, if you take the time to look away from your phone while anthony or one of the other great barbers goes to work. you can see the attention to detail and the precision being used on you the customer. the price is very very reasonable and as more word gets out about how awesome this place is i can only imagine demand will outgrow the availability. please come in see anthony and see how good they can make you look. very happy that i made the effort to come here!",5

"scariest\/shadiest grocery store experience in my life. hubby and i pulled in only to see a few cars down, people selling who-knows-what out of their car trunk. also this is the only giant eagle tht gives you a really hard time if you ever forget your advantage card and give your phone no instead (it works at the other ones just fine). then we leave by waiting for a really dazed\/swaying woman to finish wandering around back and forth in front of us, and pass by a drive-by fat cash exchange (drugs?) on our way out of the parking lot. we are definitely scared to return, and will never need grapes (or any other groceries) so desperately again.",1

we got in immediately, the shop was super clean and after letting him finish his cigar he got right down to business.  my tattoo came out beautiful and i loved that he spent a bit of extra time making sure the colors were right because stopping in for a touch up wasn't going to be easy since i live in ca.

the price was more than reasonable, the guys in there were all nice and friendly (and funny) and the quality of the work is worth way more than 5 stars.  i'd make a special trip to vegas just to have my next tattoo done there.",5

"located inside st. lawrence market, this flower shop will serve you well if you are looking for a special floral arrangement that won't break the bank.

my husband went to the greenery patch to buy a flower bouquet for work and i was pleasantly surprised when he came back.
the flowers were gorgeous. 
$74 incl. tax bought us a big bouquet that included sunflowers, lilies, mums, brandy roses (plus a few others) as well as a nice vase.

the service was very pleasant as well.
the arrangement was made from scratch while my husband was waiting and it took about 20 minutes to complete.
i had sent my husband off with a photo of a floral arrangement i had in mind and this was highly appreciated by the woman at the greenery patch.
combined with her expertise as a florist and my husband's excellent taste, the final bouquet exceeded my exceptions and we had no doubts that the person receiving it, would love it as well.",4

"i ordered take out from china chili, after leaving my choice for lunch up to urbanspoon today. i mean, i'm really broke nowadays, and i regret when i spend the little money i do have on so-so food, and i kinda regret today... 

they offer lunch combos here, but today's side soup was something with pork in it, so i had to get something else. i ordered the vegetable chow fun, and it had no flavor to it what so ever. i'm serious, just nothing. the vegetables tasted ok, the rice noodles we're ok. but mostly this was just a bland dish. i have put the remainders of it in the refrigerator in hopes it will taste better tomorrow. 

the staff was courteous and pointed me to the takeout desk. while i was waiting for my food, which wasn't long it was done pretty quickly, i took a good look at the place. it looked for the most part to be clean and reminded me of the halls that people rent out for those 20k budget weddings. many family style tables and flat screens on the walls, with ""chinese"" decorations scattered in between. wait, did i see pseudochandeliers with multicolored lights? i think i did...",3
very disappointed.  tortilla chips were way too greasy. asked for hot salsa and what we got was not only mild but also quite bland. brisket tacos were nothing special; had much tastier ones at another place around the corner.   it was their first week open so i may give it another shot... have heard some good things that don't match my experience.,2
this place is great. $20 a cut sometimes its a wait depending on when you go. i ask for a low fade and it comes out just the way i like it. im giving it 4 stars cause of the price.,4
this is the best place to eat in mcmurray.  the menu is great.  the drink menu is awesome.  i love the homemade chips.  i have never had a bad meal here and i have had almost everything on the menu.  the prices are affordable and the quality is great!,5
"for march's breakfast club uye after a little set back we walked our way to chestnut, yep it was a brisk early morning walk to breakfast, it wasn't in the plan, but that's how it unfolded.

i have to say chestnut is a cute shop, i like the open feel of it, and the staff is real friendly and helpful. and they make a great tasting mocha! 

i went with the weekend special, it was the short rib hash with 2 over easy eggs. in theory this dish would have rocked, but in reality it was a texture thing that was a little off.  the onions were twice the size of the potatoes, the meat of the short rib looked like it was just ripped of the bone and tossed in with potatoes, just all chucky, i guess i like my hash to be equal in size haha. the flavoring was great though, so i got over the size textures sort of quickly.

over all chestnut is a cute little place and glad i finally got to try them out",3
"we ordered chilli chicken, malaysian beef sataty, nasser goran fried rice and malaysian noodles. to be honest the food was good big portions but i didn't really feel a wow factor. the chilli chciken looked horrible compared federicks no comparison the beef is just okay there was nice flavor my favorite was the fried rice if i was to come back here again i would just get the nassegoran fries rice.",3
"we took our two yorkies and lab there friday - sunday.  our other kennel was booked, so we were accommodated quickly and happy to have found a place.  when we arrived, they told us they weren't as packed as they only had close to 80 dogs, whereas for the 4th of july they had close to 100!  how can they even attend to that many animals!?  

when we picked them up sunday and the yorkies' bed was covered in poop and pee.  they never do anything like this at home; especially go to the bathroom where they sleep.  we didn't realize this until we got home and uncovered the mess and embarrassment from them as we discovered it.

one of our yorkies was vomiting all night sunday night and this led to vomiting blood around 4pm and a vet bill of $100 to see what was wrong.  they said they could do x-rays, leading to a few hundred dollars or we could wait it out and see if he were to continue to vomit.  his vet gave him fluids, due to his dehydration.  and all of this was followed by diarrhea for now 3 days with boone.

today i came home to boone being in his kennel, still having diarrhea, but now the other two are just as sick and i cleaned up diarrhea for almost 3 hours; which led to renting a rug doctor for our carpet areas totaling over $70.00!  i just cried, after cleaning up vomit and diarrhea of one dog and now i'm dealing with three!

i would never take our dogs there again.  they are like children to us, but also love to run outside and play outside.  i just don't feel like they had any attention or were let out; but just caged for the weekend and expected to go out on their cement pad.  i guess shame on me for now realizing you can't ever do a basic package or attention will not be given for 3 days!",1
i worked with johnny at king of clubs to plan my best friends bachelorette party in las vegas and he was amazing! he had awesome ideas to make the weekend extra fun and special and helped plan an amazing pool party day at liquid lounge. he is very professional and truly plans a vegas trip that fits your style! i would highly recommend him.,5
"i would give this hospital and its staff 100 stars if i could. i had been in arizona for all of two weeks in 2007 when i began experiencing excruciating pain in my right leg. i was taken to mesa general and given an ultrasound. they found a dvt ( blood clot) that extended from my pelvis to my knee. i also found out i was 2 months pregnant. i was transferred by helicopter to banner desert. 
 i was terrified because i had only been in arizona a short time, i did not know anyone, i did not have insurance yet either. 
 i was seen by doctor stephanie martin, who was amazing. she was part of the phoenix perinatal associates ( who i highly recommend). she got me signed up for insurance and got my treatment started. i spent two weeks in the hospital. the nurses and techs were so friendly and caring. i had never seen anything like it before. i could not have been happier with my experience. i delivered my daughter there 7 months later and i also delivered my third child there in 2009.",5

there's never a line, and they are going to add a drive-thru soon. service is friendly and fast as well.

"came here for the ""saturday night dj session"" which was just a 97.5 tent playing top 40. we usually have a great time during the summer but they seriously need to get their bar situation figured out, only one girl running around trying to get drink orders from 7 different groups of people, going back and forth each time... it's so inefficient and we saw at least 3 different groups of people walk away angry bc they couldn't get drinks. finally and hour later we got our 2 beers. it was really frustrating bc it's not her fault.. it's a saturday and adults want to drink especially at a water park they need to have more staff in that area or at least set up some kind of outdoor bar or ice bucket situation, you guys are losing money! then when we were leaving we bought some bottled water and it wasn't ringing up, the kid just kept going back to the water case and register trying to figure out what to do. finally he rang me up for a 4.00 bottle of sobe instead, at this point we just wanted to get the hell out of there. this place is very poorly run in certain areas. also the water was freezing this time! we'll be back but definitely never on a saturday again despite the park closing later it's not worth it.",3
"this place seems totally random to get some take out but it's so good. it's in a plaza and looks like just a small grocery store but it has a hot table of amazing eats as well. 

the store is lined with a huge variety of fresh breads which are all very tasty. i got the beef kebob (come with 2 skewers) which comes with rice (your choice of 3: fava bean and dill, dried cranberry, or plain) i got the cranberry which goes surprisingly well with all the savoury flavours. it also comes with a charbroiled tomato, onion, warm pita, and a cucumber pickle, all of this for $8.

food good so why only 3 stars? food was good and the portions were hearty but it's not like my life is now complete that i've eaten here - it's good and simple. the one downer is this place feels like a secret kebab club. there is no indication on where you place your order and there is no menu or menu board. i kind of stood there looking confused trying to order not to be acknowledged by someone for a good 6 minutes which is a long time to stare a someone looking bewildered in a semi empty store.",3
"my neighbor recommended dawn so i thought i'd give her a try since she's not too far from me.  

when i brought my dog in i started to explain how i wanted his hair cut and she was listening for a while, then she said, ""i think i know what you want, i'll just do it and you can let me know what you think and we can make adjustments for the next time.""  wait, what? you're just guessing what i want without really listening? when i picked up my dog he looked fine until i got closer then i noticed some stray hairs on his paws. i asked if she could trim them and she said that my dog was a handful and he was squirming a bit but then he calmed down. i told her ahead of time that my dog is a bit anxious but she basically blamed my dog for her poor attention to detail. 

i looked closer at my dog's face and it's pretty long so i know it it will grow out really quickly which i'm not thrilled about, but if she wouldn't trim a few stray hairs on his paws i doubt she would have trimmed his face.  

dawn has been grooming dogs for a long time, so i would expect her to to have experience with a variety of dogs and to be able to handle their behaviors. a true professional would definitely not blame the dog for her inadequacies in front of its owner.  in addition i would say i am not impressed with her operation. she works out of her home which is fine, but the grooming area in her basement is cramped and filled with dog cages which is a bit unnerving. it doesn't have to be luxurious, but it could use some updating--at the very least, get rid of the 1970's paneling.",1
you dont go here for the decor or the entertainment. you go here to have  a great time at a casino where you can gamble as little or as much as you like. great place to go in my opinion!,5
"great service from the moment we called to make dinner reservations. the menu was diverse and the wine was reasonably priced. the food was delicious, especially the sticky rice and green tea dessert. we will be back soon!",5
"came with the kids on a friday for an early dinner.  always a good sign when the majority of patrons are korean.  bulgogi was a little sweet for my taste, but the seafood pancakes were excellent.  rice is a great opportunity to shine or disappoint (blow off) and they nailed it. bipimbop was good, but not great, but after two years in the bay area i'm an unfairly harsh critic.  hitting the expansive adjacent market after our meal was as much a part of the evening as the meal.  it's very well-stocked and if you don't leave with a few items you've never tied, you're probably missing the point.",4
"this is a pretty good golf course that is consistently in nice shape. while the pro shop staff is very nice, sometimes the marshals on the course can come across as a bit testy and unprofessional. there is really no need for that, especially when there are so many places in town that can offer the same or better golfing experience without the bad manners and salty dispositions. so if they can get rid of these clowns (i.e., unfunny ones i might add), i would rate the course much higher. pity it's a small minority of the staff that is holding back the ratings for this course from being a lot higher, at least in this person's opinion.",3
"like many, i went to check this place out with the coffee passport. i was meeting a friend there and we had a bit of trouble finding it since they had just moved and google maps was not reflecting their new address correctly, although, by the time you read this, i am sure it will be corrected. 

the owner was there with a barista and was nice and chatty. he told me about the previous location, the move and was overall very welcoming. kudos.

fahrenheit is tiny, although fairly open concept in design with very (actually change that to 'extreme') limited sitting. uh... 6 tall chairs if i recall... all facing outward, so no romantic lattes to be had in-house.

their latte was okay. i think this is one of those places that will either thrive with local sales on their way from or to work or die a horrible and quick death as this is not a hang out place in any stretch of the imagination. 

mostly a pick-and-go place and as such, it means they probably will not get a lot of non-local traffic in the winter months. since even though it is located on jarvis this cafe is a blink and you will miss it kinda of place. if you do find the place, then during the summer, as per jennifer k's review you can take your coffee for a walk or to a nearby park. which is okay...

so... since there was no one when we got there, my friend and i ventured into two of the chairs and yeah, they are not for long-time sitting... as such, we went to the nearby park instead.",3
just went back to big o tires on gibson for an oil change. great staff. thanks again guys...,5
"thank you jose for making our front yard looking better! jose is great at communications and his prices are reasonable. searched for a landscaper and came across jose's company, and he responded quick and was able to fit us in within a week!",5
"my god "" were the initial reactions  that my husband and i had upon our first taste of the ribs! they were delicious!  the restaurant  is a quaint little spot in the middle of uptown charlotte.  if you like soul food and want to enjoy a quick walk through time, please visit mert's heart and soul!",5
"very chill vibe and the food was great. tons of flavors, plated beautifully, and definitely not your typical tapas bar.",4
"the food was excellent! upon our waiter's suggestion we ordered posole and chilaquiles. the chilaquiles are on the breakfast menu, but the waiter let us order them at lunch time around 130pm. the food was delicious! the chilaquiles had green sauce and were very spicy but had good flavor. the posole was just me as i've had better elsewhere. we will definitely be back to check out other menu items!",4
"this is the place to go for a quick dozen or half dozen. if you want some fresh donuts after hitting the bars or before heading out for an action packed day, this is a great place to stop.

i have sampled many of the different options over the years, and the donuts are always fresh and flavorful. the folks behind the counter are courteous and efficient, and they usually chat with the customers and create a fun ambiance.

this is a great stop after having a slice at the rocky's next door!",5
best brunch in town!! dominique & waldo killed it this week. love love love this place.,5
fast italian comfort food served in large portions at an economical price point. not an eye appealing presentation but for the price you can't go wrong. lineups on the weekend so arrive early or after 8,3
"to add to my review, do not skip out on the tea while you're getting something to eat!  as i've tried most, if not all, of their noodle dishes, the tea is what keeps me coming back.

i've tried:  fruit tea, dried fruit tea, tangerine, & today, their special oolong.  all very good and refillable!  all the fruit ones are on the sweeter side while the oolong was very nice and there was enough leaves for 3 refills.

tip:  like others have said, go early if you want to get the laksa.  ""rice noodle"" looks more like a vermicelli to me.  it's coconut milk based and it is spicy, so keep that in mind!",4
always good food best value but lineups every weekend. gamberi diavola is good but add in some calamari and sub in the mussel broth for the thick paste and it would be tops.  not as big a pizza fan here but pasta dishes are great.  try the one with fior di latte too.  antipasto platter is fantastic,4
"decent place for a weekend brunch. as other reviewers have pointed out it can get busy pretty quickly. we got there around 11am and still had to wait a good 20 minutes. no big deal although if the weather was colder it wouldn't be so nice waiting outside for a table. 

it seems as if their eggs benedict is a really popular choice. i went for the truckers special which is a little bit if everything: pancakes, 3 eggs, toast, bacon, sausage and baked beans. the baked beans were too sweet but everything else was quite tasty. they don't allow any substitutions. they also have fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice. this place is a bit pricey for breakfast. 

service was pretty good. the diner itself is a bit divey. it didn't exactly feel that clean. overall an ok place but i wouldn't make a special trip out here just to eat here.",3
"liked it.  recommend it.  tip of the hat to bianca (cocktail waitress), anna from italy (ghost bar blackjack dealer) and brandy at front desk.",5
"i've been here a dozen times and love the food! it's super close and their hours are convenient. they are always very busy! expect a 20-40 min wait when you come here! as far as service, i've had everything from the waiter crying and throwing the credit card holder to amazing attentive service. they are definitely not organized but the food makes up for it! i've loved everything i've tried so far, crepes are my favorite! 

on several occasions we have had erin as our waiter and he is very good. if you're lucky enough to get him, you're in good hands! very attentive in a sincere type of way. 

i would love for this place to have a better dress code for the women, they tend to wear club-wear and it's just not appropriate for a breakfast place. also one of the managers or owners mom wears her nightgown there and it's a bit odd! 
i recommend maybe a shirt with your name or logo and some jeans! simple",4
"having two brothers help build city center i've been wanting to stay there for a bit. finally after all theses years i was able to afford to stay there for more than a day. we first stayed at the bellagio for a few days thanks to my wife's work. i want to say it was 3 days to long. once we arrived to the aria we were blown away at the difference between the bellagio and aria especially the customer service. 
 there's only one way to  describe the aria in my opinion and that is ""to be seen"". no matter where you are in the aria you can be seen. the design is and layout is brilliant. from the lobby to the the elevators to the pool to the bars and restaurants to the casino you will be seen. i love the openness of the whole casino. 
 one of the main reasons we loved the aria was our room. unlike the bellagio our aria room felt like a 5 star luxury hotel. it also had marble all over and beautiful bathroom. our view wasn't bad either, had a strip, airport, i-15 view of the monte carlo. our king room had two small couches and nice desk with an entertainment docking station that you could hook up your ipod or compute to tv for free. and once again unlike the bellagio we had a 32' flat screen that was a master controller of everything in the room from the tv to the curtains and lights all on a sleep or alarm mode. last but not least our bed was super comfy with amazing pillows. 
 our first day to relax we headed straight to the pool. where once again we were blown away by the layout, customer service and the loungers (the kind that don't get hot). plenty of shade to sun ratio with beautiful gardens separating the different areas. funny thing wasn't till the second day i figured out they had four pools, silly me. three that look similar and one adult party pool (if you can call it that). this is my number one complaint with the aria. the adult pool is smaller than the others and cost $100 or more to sit down. they need to re think there adult pool it's not worth the free admission unless your wealthy than never mind. one other thing they do that most if any don't do is water stations with free water spread out all over. i really loved the aria pools. 
 simply put the aria understands the vegas experience with home like feeling. in my opinion it is definitely one vega's best casino and hotels. we can't wait to go back as soon as possible and this time where bring the kids. i will take aria over any other any day of the week. it's worth every penny spent and you get what you pay for. with trams and escalators all over it's easy to get around city center and the strip.",5
"today was my first and final experience with dr. carl ferguson. i have found him to be pom-pas, and ill mannered. insofar as being almost hostile when asked to address the issues the appointment had been scheduled for.  if you are over weight, or have a real medical problem, dr. ferguson is not the physician to visit. he concentrated on giving information on what is considered a grain versus protein, and  told us to do research on a website for diet information, while not addressing a previously diagnosed hypertension issue at hand. 

 i wish we hadn't moved so i wouldn't have had to waste the time, and money to give me what resulted in a 4th grade education on the evils of corn, and it's effects on mid-west cattle. i understand the evils of excess weight, as most humans with a few pounds to lose do, but if he would have addressed any of the complaints that lead to the appointment  in the first place, this review would have been different.",1

"driving from california to las vegas, my car started driving incredibly rough.  not wanting to take any chances for my drive home, i decided to get my car checked out and began my research for an auto shop that wouldn't take advantage of the fact that i am a woman traveling from out of state.  yelp led me to rebel automotive and their great reviews. lee and joe were incredibly kind and honest with their diagnosis. the $39.95 i was charged for a tire balance was money well spent and rebel automotive now has a fan from california.",5
"rarely do we leave 1 star.  but this deserved it in a big way.  i've often has sbarro food in many different places and the food is usually very good.  actually i've had amazing pizza in several locations.  this was horrible.  $6 for a slice of pizza where the staff makes you feel invisible and the restaurant is filthy.  look at the floors.....ouch!!  this unit is a blip in the system, but hopefully they'll read this!  zero staff interaction with customers, only themselves...restaurant was filthy and food was cold.",1
"was with friends for the game heist. we went to fbi previously and since fbi was such a great game the expectations were high and the heist delivered. very exciting and a very fun game to play, they will open up two more games and we can't wait !

"this place is ridonkulous.  i don't use the word ""ridonkulous"" often but this place deserves it!

moved down to 4 stars from 5.  this last trip back, the food was still good bit service not so much.",4
"oh, hell yeah!!!   this is the absolute best place for popcorn. samples are available for all flavors. they will ship out of the area for you and if you return the empty tin, you get a $10. discount on the next ""tin"" refill. love this place.

"our group of 10 came in to celebrate a birthday. we ordered a few appetizers and the standout was the okonomiyaki fries. the other appetizers we ordered were wings, tom yum shrimp and mushrooms. all were pretty tasty. 
our mains ranged from their regular hot plates of reef and pasta to the premium steak and chicken dishes. my husband ordered the angus steak and i ordered the house special chicken. both were ok but a little too peppery and salty. 
service was good. everything was ok but looks like overall they are still fixing some kinks in both menu and service.",3

"this review is for sunday night swim.  

it was my first time doing night swim and i had so much fun.  they lay out the pool toys you can ride on or lay in or just hang onto.  the water is about 4 feet so a good amount for you to get your body wet.  i really like that the entire edge of the pool is a sitting area so you're still in the water opposed to sitting on the ledge of it with only your feet dipped in.   if you get there early enough you get dibs on what pool toy you wanna play with, which is nice rather than hoping someone would get off the rubber duckie or popsicle so you can use it.  if you opt to not go in the water you can hang out at the cabanas or gamble or get on the dance floor.  dress appropriately and in your swim gear.  it's a pool party guys!??!  why are you dressed up in your clubbing clothes?",5
"delicious food- fresh raspberry jam! lovely atmosphere. the chocolate cake was outstanding.  service staff are friendly and accommodating- while still figuring things out .  highly, highly recommend this place.",4
"want ""a guy""? have i got ""a guy"" for you!  

in chicago, everyone's got ""a guy"" - the guy that you easily share with everyone you know because, well, they are worth their weight in platinum. well, i've proudly got a new ""guy""! i am beginning one of many small projects in our new gently used home which is sorely in need of an update. 

need granite? these guys are that platinum standard! truly! i went to the yard a few weeks back to check out the digs. there are rows of granite and granite remnants (quartz too!) that are large enough for just about any project you may have! they are super friendly and more than willing to help you find that perfect piece. with granite, i firmly believe you fall in love...it's an emotional attachment to the natural stone that you feel and you just know it when you see it. for me, my feet tingle when i have made that special connection!  i first met aj then, but wasn't ready to commit to a piece yet. i saw a few that i liked, but needed to choose tile first.

after choosing my backspash tile, i went back there with new seriousness. this place is so amazing that the same piece of granite\/quartz likely won't be there long. so, i walked the granite row (which is huge) to look for the perfect piece. not only can you see the granite pattern easily, they also catalog each piece with a number and the size of the piece. i was given 78x32 by my builder and away i went. i found a kickin' half slab (that maybe will get me a couple of serving boards too) as well as my new bathroom counter. 

when you find a piece that you like (or a few...but don't be crazy and make them pull out 10), they will pull the pieces out so you can see them in their entirety. i worked with aj larocca who could not be a more professional and eagerly helpful ""guy""! he measured the pieces for me and one was a wee shorter so he was great to have a discussion with me as whether or not we could work with the smaller piece. he could have easily talked me into that smaller piece, but above him wanting me to have a piece i loved, he wanted to be sure i would have a piece (that i also love) that would be a better size. i totally appreciate that honesty. 

for me, finding my ""guys"" to get things done means i am settling in to my new home. i am looking forward to using aj for many more projects in our home! they have really amazing and beautiful stone there and their prices are unbeatable! if you need stone or just want to spruce up your home or office....go see my ""guy"" aj!",5
the service was very good and very attentive. the food was ok. i got the chicken salad sandwich which was very tasty. the potato salad was very bland snd i wouldn't order it again. they were very busy. all the tables were full when we were there.,3
"the ladies at splash are wonderful!  i have used their services for both my business printing and for my wedding. they have always delivered a great product in a timely fashion.   on one occasion, i had an issue with the order and they handled it beautifully, making sure i was completely satisfied with the result.  definitely recommend them!",5
"it's not too late to get your pre-sale tickets for ""a vampire tale!"" (through today, sept 4th. hey. it's only 10pm right now. i should have gotten here to tell others sooner!) only $15.00!! crazy!! even if you read this after sept 4, you will not want to miss this show and the price is still ridiculously reasonable. 

my cousin turned us onto to this dance company - we saw one of the final performances of catwalk this past season and it was tremendous. such beautiful raw talent and....hilarious! (male dancer interpretation of ""put a ring on it!"") well, hilarious, but hot! so well done.

i'm really looking forward to ""a vampire tale"" and congrats to the dancers for being selected to perform in the uk. you definitely deserve your spot!

"heard about adamson's  bbq from social media and the usual hoopla when a new hipster joint opens. as i live nearby, i rolled in for lunch a few days ago about 12.45 pm.  interesting place to say the least. quickly learned they sold everything except the brisket and some ribs. i settled for the brisket sandwich and a scoop of potato salad and a trendy craft soda. set me back $ 19.00 . 
the brisket sandwich was probably  the tastiest sandwich i've ever consumed . the meat was lightly sauced , adorned with some cole slaw and house made pickles. nice touch. the potato salad was average.  new fangled soda pop was good.
i'd love to say i'd return but the irregularity of available product , limited opening hours kind of make it difficult to plan a simple lunch.",3
"if i could give this location no stars i would. i've given this location three tries now and every time something is missing from my order or made wrong. i am currently sitting at the drive thru window. i ordered a spinach and feta omelette wrap and a smoothie. i had to come back because they didn't put any egg in the spinach and feta omelette wrap. no apology. nothing. just a ""oh, i can remake it for you."" ridiculous. awful customer service. i will never come to this location again.",1
i have gone to eleven for a long time. the first thing you will notice is the service is always great. the environment is very comfortable yet classic. you can go in jeans or get dressed up.  as for the food i have found most dishes are quite good even if the portions tend to run small.  i do hate it when the change the menu and take someone off i really like but at least it they do change. the seafood sampler is a must try. i don't love the mussels as they just didn't have enough flavor but the sausage pretty good. i do recommend soaking the bread cubes in the sauce they are amazing.,4
"noka was a major disappointment. we wanted to go to sushi on bloor but it was busy. ayce was $20.99, but we were not that hungry so we just ordered about 5 items off the menu, including ice cream at the end. i did not notice any bento box options which was unusual at a sushi place. i ordered sushi pizza and when it arrived, it consisted of 3 rice crackers with seaweed salad and salmon on top. i was expecting the traditional sushi pizza with actual rice as the base. it was such a cheap alternative. the service was not that great, many attempts were made to alert a server but they just kept walking by us. when the bill arrived we saw that  we had been charged gratuity. this is absolutely pathetic. i have never been charged gratuity unless it is a party over 6. i should be able to determine  how much i would like to tip based on the service i received which was extremely lousy. the bill came to $60 with the included tip, we should have just opted for the ayce menu, would have saved $20 and had a lot more food.

never go to noka!!! we should have just waited for a table at sushi on bloor.",1

"well it's a mid-level hotel\/motel.  way better than your average best western and they do clean your comforter and sheets before you arrive and every 4th day afterward, so that's good.  my room kind of overly smelled like cleaner solutions on the first night, but that went away after i'd had a couple of mixed drinks (that i had to bring in myself because there is seriously no bars within walking distance that i could find online...  but there is a walgreens about a block away, so that situation worked itself out...

the staff was very nice and the continental breakfast was edible.

the cleaning staff likes to leave the shower curtains on the outside of the tub, so when you take a shower and don't pay attention, all the excess shower water will pool up on the bathroom floor.

husband has basic breakfast plate and eggs and potato was well made but sausage was thick and kind of different tasting, did not like it as well. great service and there was a lovely pastry case outside that we should try sometime.  would not recommend the sausage but definitely the pancake and overall breakfast.",3
it's so damn good. it's so damn good. it so damn damn damn good. wow every dish. this may very well be the only place i'm not hesitant to try something new for fear of not enjoying it. everything i've had so far has been phenomenal and what makes this place even better they take customer service to another level if you order something and you are not one hundred percent please with it they will remove it from your ticket or replace it no questions asked got to love that,5
"do you remember when tim hortons had a bar area with bar stools (and it was spelled tim horton's)? they didn't serve booze, but you'd always find neighbourhood men planted on the stools, reading the paper, chain smoking and talking with the ladies behind the counter.

the skyline takes me back to my childhood in this respect. the regulars here are from the few seniors residences in the area. the servers (and most likely owners) are friendly and seem to know everyone who walks through the doors. 

the furniture, including booths and one awkward little table near the bar, is far older than most people reading this review. the wear on the table tops comes from years of hearty meals served fast. the regulars probably made many of the scratches themselves, literally etching themselves into the history of the place.

we were there for brunch. service was quick and serving sizes are plentiful. brunch classics are all on the menu and while you're there to let a little grease sop up your hangover anyways, take some time to soak in the aura, share your childhood memories with your friends and plan the rest of your day.",4

the menu is a little bit confusing because depending on the time of day, they have a different menu.. so at dinner time, if i feel like their delicious grilled cheese sandwich, i can't order it! at all!

needless to say, try their smoked beehive grilled cheddar cheese during lunch. it's such a delicious combination of flavors, i can't really describe it.. a little salty, a little smoky, and a whole lot of cheese.

we also tried mary's free range chicken. i've never had quinoa before so it was a little interesting for me.. but the chicken was tasty and tender.

there's so many other things i want to try here!

only downfall is prices are a bit hefty, but i imagine you are also paying for the ambience, which is on point!",4

"i highly recommend this place. i have been here a couple of times and had a good experience but there is not a lot on the menu for me as i am a vegetarian. tonight, i mentioned to our waiter, after ordering only dessert, that they should really get a veggie burger of some sort on the menu. he then mentioned it to the manager who came over and talked to me about what sort of veggie burger i was thinking and then disappeared into the back. next thing i know he came out with a house made veggie burger patty that the chef whipped up in very little time with what he already had in the kitchen. i have been a vegetarian for 12 years. this is one of the best veggie burgers i have ever had. i, and my parents, gobbled that up quick. then the chef came out with the manager to talk to me (pretty awesome), get my opinion on it. two thumbs up for sure! next they brought out the veggie burger patty with bun and toppings and sauce to see how i thought that was. the sauce was amazing. the way he made it up with all the toppings was amazing. so amazing that i ate the onions, i do not even like onions. seriously, if you are a vegetarian, or not, ask for this. this is some of the most amazing service i have received at a restaurant ever. the staff is super friendly, the chef is amazing, the food is delicious. what is not to like?!",5

"to sum up this show in one word: terrible.  i didn't mine the lip-synching, i half expect it from a pop princess who has mediocre singing abilities.  but, i've always appreciated britney's dance ability.... an ability that has apparently left her (or maybe she just doesn't really care) because ms. spears didn't dance at all.  instead she jazz walked around the stage the whole time (if i was rating the jazz walk alone she'd at least get 3 stars).  her lack of dancing was even more evident when she did try to half-a** dance when surrounding by her truly incredible, and talented dancers.  the entire audience was there to see one person, and one person alone and that was britney.  you would think she could at least interact with the crowd who paid upwards of $100 to see her ""perform,"" that her interactions would be genuine at least and frequent at best.  not the case, she maybe spoke directly to the crowd twice and both times her phrases were so rehearsed it came off as unauthentic.  at one point a girlfriend i was with turned to me and said, ""you know what i like about britney?  that any one of us could get up there and do what she's doing.""  and she was right.  britney was clearly phoning it in, and even from my mediocre seats i could tell her lack of passion.  she's either highly-medicated (probable) or just doesn't care anymore (even more probable).  what a dissapointment, save your money and go see the hundred or so other performers on the strip that still enjoy entertaining.  hang it up brit.",1

"i needed to print out an employee handbook for my work because i was going to be training someone the next day. they pulled up my file and told me everything was good to go. i was going to pick it up later in the day. a couple hours later i got a call and they told me it looked like the material might be copyrighted so they wouldn't copy it. there was no copy right. i have had this file printed many times and never had a problem. i went in and talked to david about it and they were still not helpful. never going back there, regardless of cheap prices.",1
"this is one of my favorite sushi spots. i come here all the time with my fiancé and some friends. their yellowtail collar is the best, whenever they have it haha. 

i also love their garlic edamame. 

the all you can eat is worth it here if you come at a certain time when drinks are buy one get one free. 

the employees and managers are amazing and always give us a warm welcome when we get there. since we are regulars.",5
"with all this hype, i thought i might jump on the bandwagon to have a taste of asia. 

when i went in, i was a little startle by the huge pictures of their product. the cashier gave me the paper to choose my order. after paying, someone from behind proceed in making my dessert. 

i end up with a dessert that cost me 10 dollars. needlessly to say, i finish it in 10 minutes. 

it takes a little bit of getting used to.. it is good. i had better desserts from asia tho.  i will try another  product or flavor on my second visit.",3
not much to say on this one as it's a pretty simple establishment. just great donuts made fresh with a huge variety. this place gets five stars for knowing what they're good at and sticking to it. both of the donuts i tried were two of the best i've had in my three years in arizona.,5
"this is absolutely the best pool company in phoenix. hands down. they are honest, which we all know is a huge plus, they do exceptional work, and they are genuinely just a great group of people. 
they fixed our swamp of a pool, i kid you not. it looked like something on t.v. the pool motor was only working at partial capacity, and we tried to keep it going , but needed help. when i started looking i thought it would be easy, but a lot of places just offered cleaning services. i then saw complete pool care online, and they had good reviews, had been in business since the 80's, and that says a lot right there. they were the first company and only company i ended up calling. they aren't like used car salesmen, and they didn't push. they educated us thru the entire process, and went out of their way if question or worries came up.
i will always use them and have recommended them to others is someone asks. i feel bad for people if they choose the wrong company, because of the prices, or the headaches that come with the problems. i know there are some quality pool places in phoenix. but i seriously doubt that they are as good as and could no way be better than complete pool care. please take my word on this. i am just lke all of you reading, looking. when it comes to any pool service, or maintenance or anything, no need to look further. sorry such a long review, but they are worth it.. just call them and see for yourself.
thanks!! 5 stars all the way!",5
"quick, painless, reasonable (great) price.  i will keep going there methinks.",4
"for the price, it's a decent place to stay. i wouldn't mind it. their gambling tables are on the older side but gets the job done.",4
"absolutely the worst experience i have had with an service company, and that's. not easy to say! i have had two appointments with them and both times they have exceeded their 4 hour appointment window without calling. i was forced to use them because i needed my bosch dishwasher repaired and this is the only authorized service they (bosch) would give me. my next complaint will be to bosch, do not use kings appliance repair, you have been warned!",1
i've been here a few times but this time was the best. our server carlie was amazing. very attentive with a great attitude. i'm not sure when you all hired her but she is a huge asset to your team. the food was the best i've had here as well. cheers to a great job!,5
"nice location at the linq promenade. very loud establishment! it's hard to have a conversation in there. not a good date place.

the people that work there are super nice and attentive, and always checked to see if we needed anything, that's key!

the food was ok, not the best. the guacamole we had to send back as it was brown and not tasty. the second one we got was fresh but still bland, we had to add lots of salt and pepper to get some flavor. 

we went at happy hour, so nothing really to complain about, as the prices are really decent. 
nice place to visit if you're in the area.

me go back? ahhh, maybe, if i was cruising that area and was hungry, but wouldn't go otherwise.",4
"we enjoy food from here on a regular basis. everything is always fresh and delicious. we are fans of their soups, chicken and broccoli, and singapore rice noodle to name s few (there eggrolls could be better i would pass). the service and friendly staff is outstanding.",5
"wow 

even though there was a wait to get our order in and to get water the food was so worth the wait. 

we set a reservation at 7pm but arrived early, the hostess said there would be a 10min wait so we waited outside. the chef came out to apologize and sat us right away. he was super nice but even if he hadn't done that - the food speaks for itself. 

word to the wise - make reservations",5
"i'm  not sure i can write enough about this resort.  it baffles my mind that at this stage of evolution vegas has redefined itself yet again by the addition of the cosmopolitan or as the locals will label it: the cosmo

the cosmo is different........  i say different because, unlike the normal casino\/resort that was once only a place to gamble and enjoy cheap drinks and subpar restaurants the cosmo seems to hit on every single level.  not only is almost everything from top to bottom world class, but everything inside is an experience! the selection of restaurants cause you to think outside the norm and break free of the traditional menus of cafe, buffet, steakhouse.  each chef takes pride in playful spins on traditional menu items.  you can experience fusion in burgers and shakes at holsteins; french & american classics at comme ca; sexy steak at stk; sushi and fresh surf at milos\/blue ribbon; and hispanic ethnic fusion at jaleo.  

the casino has several lounges; not bars.  you can expect fresh ingredients and upscale cocktails with areas to mingle around every single corner.  pre-porhibition style cocktails with style throughout the entire property.  the spa is world class with services never before seen in vegas.  maybe the best part of the resort; the rooms.

almost every room has a balcony with a great view of the vegas strip.  some rooms even come complete with a kitchen as the original concept of the cosmo was a condo-hotel.  if you want shopping you can have a suit created for you while sampling fine single-malt scotch at stitched.

this place offer something different as i stated before.  it's a breath of fresh air and fresh fun to vegas.  as someone who grew up here in vegas i'm overly joyed to have a place like cosmo leading the charge in a new wave of thinking and a new wave of having a blast in vegas!",5
"this spot reminds me of the restaurants i used to hit with my family as a kid. no frills service and decor, amazing food.

my cousin and i have come here a couple of times to completely freak out, dumpling style. we've had beef dumplings, pork dumplings, fried and steamed. we've had the spicy lamb hot pot and the chive pancake. all delicious.

get there early, the place fills up at dinner time!",4
"the age of the strip mall and the small size of the establishment belies the high quality of both the food and service of oasis. sitting on the counter were three bags of take-out waiting for their hungry owners as the middle-aged asian woman cheerfully took our orders in a heavy but not indecipherable accent. 

our dishes of chicken lo mein and thai basil string bean chicken came out quickly, piping hot, and full of flavor. the chicken tasted like ""real"" chicken as opposed to the more over-starched chicken all too-common in chinese fast-food establishments such as this. the noodles were tender, seasoned thoughtfully, and reminded me of the type grandmother used to make for me as a boy. the highlight of the meal however was the string beans. stir-fried to perfection, they came out bright, crisp, and succulent, and paired nicely with the fresh white rice.

it was truly odd to taste such authentic chinese food out of plastic take-out containers because if i was blind-folded, the dinner could have very easily passed for a more upscale sit-down type of restaurant that would have charged me double for the same food.  a man who i believe is the owner checked in during our meal to ensure everything was to our satisfaction, and a darling elderly woman with a permanent smile made sure our cups were always full of water. this has permanently replaced panda express for me. hopefully as time goes on the high quality will remain.",5
best taro boba ever!!!! so bomb & the donuts are really good too. service is terrible though and the lady working the drive thru at 4 in the morning is very rude and they barely had any donuts to choose from. still coming back for the taro tea though.,4
"great prices, delicious sushi. i have a few things i don't like in my rolls like mayo and cream cheese. they always custom tailor whatever rolls i want. 

i've had the all you can eat which is a huge bargain (at $24.95 for dinner) if you're a big eater like the fancy rolls. some of them are $13, 14 for one. so you quickly get your money's worth.  

i have also went a la carte when i wasn't as hungry and it's also good. 

either way, go here.",5
great carolina burger... service is fast. price was ok. just can't afford to come often. burger and fires with no drink. $13. but do like to treat myself every other month. lol,4
"a nice little secret spot that has incredible food, great selection of drinks (especially beer) and extremely friendly service. the prices of everything is very good as well. a nice little indie restaurant that definitely deserves a shout out. extremely recommend!!",5
"my step by step experience:

arrived to a very beautiful and calm resort (first impression,  classy!)

drove in at night. the surrounding prior to arriving to the mini neighborhood was dark,  eerie, and very desolate with little to no population or traffic in sight (not a thought that comes to mind when visiting vegas but it is off-site).

entered to the look of lavish and luxury.  no lines. easy check in! all is well and i am loving it!  i was informed that i was upgraded to a suite (but note, i am a diamond member and many hiltons upgrade diamond members on availability).

*flaw: the only parking garage is a distance from the rooms.  may be difficult for people who can't walk the distance. 

entered the parking garage to about 4 maybe 5 cars (my thoughts?  crap!!!!  this place is going to be haunted! (side note: i'm from california.  it is known to be a thing)).

we enter from the parking garage with the movie ""the shining"" in mind.  the bridge from the garage to the hotel is run down and the previous casino connected to it closed down.  

*flaw:  no more casino.  this is vegas. not the strip but it's still vegas.  i need to be able to lose money somewhere on-site!

the elevator is a vintage style with infinity mirrors. the hallways are lush and beautiful but the hotel was so quiet and lonely it was eerie. (going to admit.  i was a bit scared!) 

the room was gorgeous and i cannot complain physically about the furniture or the service because everything was quality and top notch!

the pool looked fabulous and clean. the restaurant was spectacular and the waiters were a delight. 

my overall stay was a delight but this location would be more ideal for a wedding,  reunion or convention and maybe a get-away if not a haunted-hotel trip for halloween and much less  of a vegas trip for tourist.

in conclusion,  i am docking a star for emptiness and lack of promotion and hold you responsible for the ghost-town environment.  although,  i liked the vip treatment and the feeling of having a whole hotel to myself,  the ghostlike vibes shouldn't be due until october.",4
"i didn't really feel like i waited to long for my appointment which is nice, i felt very comfortable, its very professional and it was my first time today :)",5
"great location. outside seating and the food is great as always! the people serving the food are nice, friendly and they work fast! the line was wrapped around when we walked in, but the line never stopped moving. good choice, anytime.",5
pricey (6 tacos and 2 drinks for $25) but the tacos were delicious and flavorful. we unfortunately couldn't tell which was which but we're not picky. we split everything between two people and wish they had given us two plates instead of just one. service was quick enough - we weren't in a rush. nice location - in the same place as a pizza place and donut shop. we got donuts for dessert.,4
"we were on a family trip in scottsdale and found chez vous. it's a great little french place with very warm and friendly service. the quiche and omelette were very good, as was the coffee. i also had the tarte tatin which was exquisite. if you are in the area it is well worth a visit.",5
"got me right in. changed brakes, oil, and rotated tired. 

done in 4 hrs. told me the price estimate. stuck to it. honest and very helpful.

great service!",5
"we have been going to this location since it opened.  about 10 years ago it was awesome.  we even visited a couple times a week and never sent back a meal.  

understandable, over the years ownership and management has changed...but for this location, it's been for the worst.  much worse.  

we are to blame for still going here so often even though the food is totally hit or miss. nine out of ten times the steak is overdone.  even when we explain to the server prior to ordering and ask his recommendation on how to order the steak, it's still like leather. 

ok, so i feel really bad for saying this because i'm thinking management reads yelp...but the manager who walks around is just plain creepy.  plus he doesn't know how a steak should be made.  we complained about a super well done steak and he asked me if it was over or under done.  the thing was black!   i suppose it's nice he walks around, but send a manager that doesn't make people feel uncomfortable.",2
"best instructors, high energy, great for all ages, shapes, and sizes!  always feel so much better after taking one of their classes",5
"san tropez was our first stop on our apartment hunting experience & after seeing it we knew nothing else would come close! this complex looks like a resort all around. i don't know if i have a favorite feature yet, but having gates that allow access to the scottsdale bike path is definitely a huge plus. we can't wait to move in next month!",5
jacob pierced me! he's awesome!! i got my tragus pierced and it looks amazing!! i only go to htc to get my piercings!,5
"when the most recent health inspection debacle revealed the same offenses (food handling, contamination, hand washing) as inspections in the past, it sent a message. it was a blatant disregard for the public's health and safety. it stung more because i was very adamant about forgiveness and continued to patronize their restaurants after the salmonella incident. i've never had a food poisoning issue, but now it felt like a gamble to dine with them. i've made a choice to not support a business that has repeated offenses of this nature (regardless of what they claim is not their fault) based on principle.

my recent visit was prompted by the celebration of a good friend's graduation. we joined her and her family on their vacation to las vegas (i had forewarned them about the events). in any case, our dining experience was mostly pleasant and i was admitedly excited to eat some of my favorite dishes again. 

the hostess was kind enough to accomodate our large group in one of their semi-private dining booths\/tables with drapes (although these proved difficult for the servers and bussers since they had to constantly move them to reach the table). everyone was really friendly, but service was just okay. several times we were searching for our server or anyone to come to our aid or just replenish water.

the food was still as delicious as i remember. my favorites being the stuffed dates, firefly fries, paella (mixed), and pork empanada. the only disappointment was the tuna tartare, which was also an old favorite. but overall, i enjoyed my meal. also, i really liked the chocolate tres leches cake.

so, the food is still good and service is okay. doesn't change how i feel about the business and their owners. dine at your own risk.",3
"i seriously have no complaints about this place! our check in was supposed to be at 3pm but we arrived at 12:00pm and early check in wasn't a problem.i stayed for one night with my boyfriend for his 21st birthday. we told the front desk girl that we were here for a special occasion and slipped her a $20 bill. 

she upgraded us to the tower deluxe room and sent up a complementary bottle of champagne. there were jacuzzi jets in the bathtub and a king sized bed. they also do room service check ups late at night like around midnight just to make sure we have enough towels etc. the cleaning lady gave us chocolates when we opened the door. awesome! the overall feel of the hotel is not so bad either. the decorations and plants in the lobby look extravagant and there are lounges and bars to hang out at downstairs even though we didn't go exploring too much. overall, i recommend this hotel if you're looking for a very nice place for a cheap price!

pros:
-good service
-complementary upgrades
-located in the middle of the strip
-early check-in

cons:
none",5
"my fiance and i had planned to get married in hawaii but then money got a little tight so we decided to get married in vegas and have fun. i looked around and saw the tahiti village package on vegas wedding's website and knew i would choose this chapel. i always thought the whole elvis in a chapel thing was kinda tacky for my tastes. (but you better believe i found him on the strip later and took a picture!) they were very courteous on the phone and email and when we finally got to the location they were friendly and professional. my wedding came out exactly how i wanted it: simple, tropical and fun. 

i used their hair\/makeup option and the lady was very nice and did an amazing job on me. (i've never been good with that stuff) elaine came to our hotel room and even helped me with my heavy dress since nobody else was around. i also have a large surgical scar on my arm and she covered it up so you couldn't see it in any of the pictures.

i read some of the reviews for the photography so i had already hired another photographer for when we left the ceremony. when we came back to choose the pics that the chapel took during the ceremony we were blown away how beautiful they came out. i guess the light in the resort maybe gave better pictures? we ended up buying the whole bunch and now have tons of pictures of our day. who needs hawaii when i can have a shorter flight, cheaper and less jet lag? :)",5
"owners are super nice. the food is amazing. if you haven't tries middle eastern food, this is the place you should go to for a great introduction. everything is amazing. there hummus is smooth and creamy, not to forget made fresh like everything else. the lentil soup is the best i have tasted and want more of. 
it cost is very reasonable and the service can't get any better.
be adventurous and try out the menu. you can not go wrong with the quality of their food.

try out this restaurnt, is fantastic!!!",5
"if zero stars was an option i would have selected it!! food at the other locations have always been quite good. but the staff at this location are so lazy and awful that it makes even good food unpalatable. the phone rings and rings and they couldn't give a hoot. finally decided to come in person for takeout and saw that the place was near empty! they said they were ""too busy"" to answer. too busy doing what???!! clearly, too busy to work. there is no excuse to not answer their phones, especially when you offer takeout and delivery.  sooooo many better midddle eastern places in this great city of ours. do not waste your time!!",1
"fashion birthday party for a 8 year old girl!!! surpassed my expectations.. decor, service and custom items were spot on! i would recommend this location to anyone interested in planning a event especially for little girls.",5
i went into cash a check i got from a friend of mine for work i did on his house.the girl told me i needed to be verified and someone would be right there. after about 1015 minutes of waiting a girl came by and asked was waiting for. she said wait right here i'll be back in a minute. after about 10 more minutes i gave up and left. this will be a non-issue if everybody was busy but they were not there were people without customers all over the bank,1

"went here for live music on wednesdays. the group was great and had a good atmosphere of people. if i could give the food and service more than 5 stars i would. i had the filet bites and they were worth the price! so glad there is a place in my neighborhood where i can enjoy great food, great live music, and great service!",5
"i was referred to this office from nafb for back pain during my pregnancy. i am currently sitting in the office and it is not a positive experience so far. my appointment was at 10:30 and i arrived about 5 minutes early after the 50 minute drive from my home. i waited in the waiting room for over 10 minutes without being acknowledged. there wasn't anyone in the office when i arrived. when two women finally came up, i heard my name get called to come to the counter. i then stood and waited while the receptionist was on the phone with a personal matter about her home. she got off the phone and i still wasn't greeted. instead i received an, ""id and insurance card"". i gave her my info and i was handed some papers and told what to fill out. i filled it out quickly and there i sat and waited. the front office was so hot i felt like i was going to pass out. they had a speaker pointed at the lobby with the radio on that was way too loud for an office setting. finally at 11:08 i was called back. i had my temp and blood pressure checked by the assistant, who was actually a nice person. now here i am in a treatment room almost one hour after my appointment time waiting. and waiting. and waiting. meanwhile i sit here hungry, hot and tired.",1

"'twas the day after xmas...
vegas buffet lines were going a-crazy. 
every human was starving (yes, even the little ones)
and all were waiting. 
so we hop into this line, hoping the 25min drive out would deter all...
alas it did not, for a 3.5 hr wait we were told...

hunger a-growing, the anticipation mounting...
all to fizzle as we feasted 2 hrs later. 
'twas mediocre, though shrimp and crab legs were a plenty. 

lobster mac & cheese and the desserts were studio b's saviors. 
as were the hazelnut cream and creme brûlées.

dancing lattes and unlimited red wine fill our dreams.

we retire for the night ready to brave another line and buffet the next day.",3
"we used to line up at pizza napolitana in the freezing cold, and give up after 20 minutes, only to saunter into this place, on the corner of dante and st. laurent. 

i think a lot of people have discovered this little gem the same way, and this place is building up tidy little reputation for excellent service, great italian soul food, and space when napolitana is full.

put it this way - when we're looking for somewhere to eat hearty italian when it's minus 20, fornarina is starting to land in the first-choice spot, repeatedly. it's that good! others have clearly caught on, because it's getting fuller each time we go.",4

"dr. rachel has done wonders for me regarding a pinch nerve in my lower back. after just two sessions with the dr. i went from having constant (24\/7) severe leg pain to just minor discomfort. also my blood pressure is much lower, appetite healthier. this all has lead to a much better outlook on live and a healthier overall attitude. no drugs to mask pain and cause unpleasant side effects ; but actual treatment to alleviate the problem so that i can get on with my life. i highly recommend consulting dr. rachel for what ever physical or mental health issues you may have. sincerely k.j.d.",5
"soo, last night was my 2nd dining experience at noca and it definitely blew out my expectations!! 

on sundays, they do a ""simple supper"" where the menu is limited to only a few choices of entrees...everything else is set! the best part is that the price is set at a bargain $35 for all 3 courses and they offer a simple cocktail (last night was a cherry lime martini) and a simple red and white wine each for $5! (the rest of the wine list is available though!) 

as always, the service was impeccable and i really enjoyed the bartender! he was super helpful and even clued us in on one additional special starter they were offering of a sea urchin panna cotta with lobster for $14. now the bf and i love sushi, but aren't huge uni fans. omg am i glad we tried it! the bf described it as the ocean with a touch of cream! pure heaven! 

our second course arrived as a simple salad of beets. it was fantastic and we both nearly licked our plates clean! for the entree course, the bf had the flat iron steak, while i had the halibut. both were simple, delicious and wonderful! there was nothing left of either and specifically, the celery roon and parsnip puree was amazing! 

next came the standard cotton candy course which is always fun and then dessert! who doesn't like an ice cream sundae with all the toppings of your choice!?!? the bf literally ate all the hot fudge while i indulged in the roasted pine nuts, strawberry sauce, cookie crumble and cherries! so delicious!! 

really, this food is great and i love the idea of the simple sunday menu! it changes every week, which is posted on their website, and it is a great, less expensive way to try some of the best food in az! can't wait for sunday now!!!",5
"happy easter we have no cream cheese!  well no plain cream cheese and no strawberry.  does the staff know this? of course not.  ""maybe you should move each tub of cheese and look"".  very unprofessional.  would suggest maybe posting a sign before you order that you are out of at least plain cream cheese.  sounds trivial but when you are a bagel store one would expect you to have what you sell.  i will admit that in the past we did not run into this issue.  the bagels were good the service was not.  clean store too!",3
"called matt, the owner, about installing a new gate and automatic opener for our external garage.  he came out, took a look at the job and promised me a quote ""within a few days"".  two weeks passed, during which i sent him an email and left him a voice mail, but never received a response.

if the job wasn't right for him or he was too busy or whatever, i would have preferred he be straight with me and simply say that.  not responding at all is unprofessional and indicative of a poorly-run business in my opinion.",1
had a really nice time (we usually do)! my children love chuckes! it's a little pricey but we had a coupon to make it a little better!! it's usually pretty crowded however it was nice and not so bad.  the only thing i would say is i wish chucky would have stayed out longer so i could but picture with the kids.,4
"i have not ventured to the east side location that the other reviewer (laura kate) was referring to, but i've been fairly impressed with this location.  it's not huge, but i've found some high quality items here:  coffee table books, kitchen accessories, and high end clothes (banana republic, dockers, etc.).  another thing that i've found goodwill great for is board games.  you will want to check that all the pieces are there, but a lot of times i've found games that are practically never used and cards are still unopened.  most of these are $1-2! 
if you can get past the stigma of second-hand shopping, you can find things for a steal here, and other goodwills.",4
"i can only speak for the bar.  what a cool atmosphere.  it was very dark, there were paintings all over, mirrors on the ceilings, antique looking bookcases with old looking books...there was no cover.  lucky for me, i had a local who was my tour guide.  we arrived about 3am and danced until 7am, fueled with quite a few vodka and red bulls.  quite a different place, you must try it!  you might end up dragging yourself out when the sun comes up!",5

this place was voted best of vegas 2007, best pulled pork 2007...i say hog wash!!
 
this place earns 2 stars at best.  too much sauce, very sweet sauce (which i usually like) but when you can't tell what is under the sauce, eeww...the ribs were tough and had no flavor.  service left a lot to be desired! price, pretty good.  yelp had a special ($10 for $20) so the cost of dinner, cash out of pocket was $10 which included a tip.

"i'd heard a lot about the noodle house before going, and located in the shangri-la hotel, i expected high quality food and service. though i didn't leave with a bad taste in my mouth (in regards to the food or the service), i find myself forgetting i went here. which may even be worse.

a last minute decision to visit, my boyfriend and i visited the restaurant for lunch. we ordered the pork buns for appetizers, and i tried the momofuku ramen. the pork buns were good, but growing up in markham and eating copious amounts of chinese food all my life, it was nothing special. 

the ramen was just okay. a bit too salty for my preference and the dish came out a bit too quickly to have, or seem to have been prepared without much thought or care. while i know that soup will have been pre-made, the dish did seem slopped together and tasted so.

a bit of a disappointing experience, momofuku is not a repeat for me.",2
"when i first came here i thought this was literally the best coffee in the mesa gilbert area. their espresso was of clearly high quality and taste was phenomenal! the past couple times i've been here the place has gotten more popular and it seems as if their quality has decreased. the sharp taste of espresso is gone, and i'm left with subpar quality. i hope they bring their quality back up because this spot was a gem!",3
this little smokey hole in the wall is a really cool spot.  the decorations are what bring everyone here.  every inch is covered and it is something to be seen.  if you are in the area at christmas time it shouldn't be missed.,4
"average ayce sushi place with decent prices. the place isn't too busy so i've never had to wait for a table. the service is decent. they put too much rice for the nigiri i find and it's often pretty dry. the sashimi isn't cut evenly either, with a larger piece on one end. 
 tip: 10% off when paying by cash, but everyone at the table has to pay by cash for the discount.",3
"as my loyai readers know, i never like deducting stars from a prior rating--especially for a place that i previously rated 5 stars.  however, i feel the need to do so in this case for a major reason: false advertising.

i came by this past sat. for lunch to try the sushi, since i'd long been wanting to do so, and i've been on a sushi kick lately.  i'd heard this place had the best sushi in pgh, and the sushi i'd seen in the photos and on others' plates had looked promising.  before going, i looked up the prices on the website, and the price for the sashimi lunch, the platter that most interested me, was listed as $9.50.  i didn't see it listed on the chalkboard menu anywhere, but figured the price listed on the website would be accurate.  imagine my surprise when, after eating, i went to pay and was told that it was actually $14.99.  what had actually seemed like not a bad deal for the quality and quantity of sushi i received quickly turned into quite a pricey lunch.

i would be remiss to mention that the sashimi itself was incredibly fresh and excellent in quality, so i was very pleased with it in that regard.  (my favorite component was the octopus--i loved the texture!)  i also found the quantity to be appropriate for a lunch portion--at least, for me (perhaps not so much if you're a large guy).  and, as an added plus, the presentation was pretty, and service was efficient.  so, i must agree that this is indeed the best sushi i've tried in pgh, and is 5 star quality in that regard.

if the difference between the price on the website and the actual price had been a dollar or two, i probably would have let it slide, esp. in light of the quality.  however, a 50% difference in price is substantial, esp. to someone like me who doesn't exactly have money to burn.  i'm not sure if the difference was intentional, to lure people in, or unintentional, as in the sushi page hasn't been updated in years.  in any case, though, this is a major discrepancy that needs to be corrected.

aside from the price differential, a couple other minor things bear mentioning.  the first is that i find the order first and pay after system unintuitive and unnecessary, given that there's no real waitservice or even a bar.  the second is that the sushi menu isn't readily apparent to newcomers who approach the front counter to order.

although i'm leaning towards a 3 star rating, i'll be generous and average my previous 5 star rating with my 3 star experience this time and award a 4.  i'm pretty sure i'll be back again at some point to try a soup or classic fish sandwich, though it'll probably be awhile.  we'll see if they can redeem themselves in the meantime.",4
"where do i start? dirty bathroom, stinky hallways and rooms, clogged sink, stained carpets and couches, leftover food crumbles in the tv stand, filthy bedsheets and ultimately the worst customer service. the only one thing that is good about this place is the roof deck view of the las vegas strip that is free if you are a hotel guest. guests also get a discount on the sky jump and other rides. but that is definitely not worth the stay here. i could get a good hotel on the strip and just pay to visit the deck.

first of all, stratosphere is farther down on the strip where it doesn't even feel like you are on the strip anymore. if you are walking on the strip, do not walk till here! it takes around 20 minutes from the venetian casino by bus.

next thing is the long long checkin and checkout lines. there are only 2 or 3 people working at any time no matter how long the line is. and they are very very slow! we had to wait for hours to checkin and checkout. no automation - where are we with the technology?! and from the state of the room we got, i am guessing a lot of people took more time because they had to complain about it.

two words: avoid statosphere!",1
"casablanca is an utterly delightful card shop just off the tourist beaten track in newington.

selling a number of quirky gifts, from old fashioned wind up toys and wooden snakes to gorgeous girly ornaments, there's something for everyone inside. they have some older, refined styles of cards, gift wrap and gifts but a lot of their collection is contemporary and funky. 

it's fairly big inside so they have room for a lot of stock, and you could lose yourself for a good while in here deciding what you want to buy for a loved one. personally i loved their tiny candles in porcelain heart candle holders - five for 2 pounds was a steal! they would be great for birthday parties or for dinner soiree's. all in all, it's a lovely shop with lots of variety, and i'm glad the name of the store enticed me in! 

what's a store like you doing in a place like this? it's bringing a great selection of gifts and quirky collectables to the community of newington, that's what!",4
i went to see sasha. she was recommended by several of my co-workers. she took a late break just to help me. my eyebrows are amazing. i will be returning.,5
"it is a wait because they are a popular bakery. i went in hoping they would have a cake for my mom and dads anniversary. and was very happy that they could squeeze everything i wanted on the cake! great people working behind the counter, fast, proficient, kind and courteous!",5
meh. close to the strip so gets a ton of play. it can range from 15$ for locals to like $195 peak or something absurd. just time it right i guess. i've looked on golfnow and been shocked a few times. today i am writing because i showed up to practice and the entire facility is rented out. just weird. looks like they are making the putting green huge again. this used to be a go to spot to practice but i haven't hit off the grass since last spring.maybe changes are coming but so many better deals in town. course has some nice holes but in reality i can't believe the pga was here at one point.  nice staff though. good food.  glorified muni is a good description. decent to play. sucks to practice. having to call to see if the range is open is very '90's.,2
"thought this would be the best option to have rather than the food in the mgm food court.   the sandwiches have a good size for their price and taste pretty good.

i ordered the warm turkey with bacon.  they offer a very decent portion of bacon and the bread was soft and fresh.  i saved half for later since one half was too much for me.  

good and fast service.  def better than the mcdonald's at the food court!",3
brunch at giadda's was total perfection.  the lobster roll was delicious.  the white sangria was refreshing.  now the service was just outstanding.  stephanie was very friendly and attentive.  i definitely will come back to try dinner or lunch.  the view of the strip was an added bonus on this visit.  very happy!!,5
"we're quite lucky to be in montreal and to have a place where we can ski and hike in about an hour of time. i wouldn't be able to tell about the ski conditions of this year since i haven't been up north but i heard this year was a little bit tough due to the global warming.

it's an awesome place to visit, not huge but enough to be part of for a day.friendly place for people of all ages, yes, also for kids! i wouldn't know much about the hotel prices because i usually stay at our chalet.",3
"if you like sweetness, the peanut sauce lover dish is amazing.  i've eaten this for years and it's always good.",5
"decided to try this pizza place out due to all the great yelp reviews. we called in our order and was ready by the time we got there. they have 2 parking spots for to-go orders in which you call and they bring your order out. 

we ordered their caprese salad (different name the menu but same concept) and while it was fantastic the price for what we received was sad. there were 12 quartered pieces of red  tomato and slivers of basil with a nice hunk of a more creamy mozzarella. they give you plenty of mozzarella but a few extra tomato slices and a lot more basil would make this salad worth the $12. as it stands its a one person appetizer. 

we ordered the do fara special pizza. it comes in thick crust only which was good (burnt on the edges so that was a let down), however the pizza sauce tasted like spaghetti sauce. that was something i hadn't expected and didn't care for. if i wanted spaghetti i would have ordered it. the pepperoni was small and over cooked. the basil was itty bitty and couldn't even be tasted. 

i'll give this place on more chance when we're feeling like pizza again, but after this first experience i'd have to say that even papa john's has better pizza then what we had tonight.",3
"at the top of the palm's hotel you'll find a beautiful restaurant serving great food. we came here specifically to celebrate my nieces' 21st birthdays. chef marlon simbulan did not disappoint. he came out with glasses of champagne to wish my nieces a happy birthday and to kick off a fun night of celebrating. they loved how they were treated by the sous chef, wait staff, and chef. it was also a treat riding up to the 51st floor and walking into a restaurant with beautiful window views of vegas and gorgeous high ceilings. we ordered a bunch of food, and i particularly loved the meatballs and lobster mezzaluna. it was an awesome night! i highly recommend you try out nove italiano!",5
i scheduled just in time moving on recommendation from a friend they were great. they showed up 15 minutes early got the work done quickly and without damaging any of my stuff. bobby and martin were awesome guys and a pleasure to work with. i'd ask for them specifically the next time i move. you'll pay a little more for their services but in my opinion it is worth every penny. if you're moving use these guys!,5
"best cajun in the valley!! always busy, but for good reason. also have great drinks for awesome prices!!",5
"a great place to just relax and read some books. the  staff (an old couple probably) don't disturb you when ur reading or just browsing the books, but when you ask them to look for some book, they are really nice and helpful. quiet and cozy place to stay away from the noisy world outside. always can find some little surprises between the shelves.",5
"ok so it's not the prettiest bar i've ever seen and the initial service was beyond slow.. but they can seriously get a crowd going. the music was on point and the singer really engaged with the costumers. 
with all the options at the mgm by far this bar was the only one with life in it. 

the drinks were ok but we ended up switching to a simple pour to get it faster as the bar on saturday was filled with people shoulder to shoulder. 
our server at the table was nice and prompt specially considering how busy the place was which made up for the service that lacked bar side.

the bartenders were useless even at the beginning when the place was still empty. avoided eye contact like a plaque and so after sitting bar side for 10 min ( yes that's how patient we were), i finally waved one down and when ignored i yelled ""excuse me"". i hate that and it's not my style but what's it gonna take for a girl to get a drink at an empty bar, jeez.",3
"if you're looking for a horrible experience this is definitely the place for you to wander down in to. as long as you're willing to be told low wait times, yet wait over four times their time limit, this is the place for you!  the employees here are very unorganized and seem to not care much about any customers they have. they tend to ignore you while you're  patiently waiting. if this sounds like a fun time to you, then hurry your rear end down and join the  excitement. i have had to ask for a rain check twice since the wait times have been much longer then i've been told. you're definitely better off going to pole position.",1
"went after church with granny on a sunday.  the place is bigger than i thought.  the music was shlightly too loud.  was happy that they use ceramic crockery and not plastic.  they don't have ramen but rice and udon.  chairs may back against your table so be careful when kids run toward you.  the peach yoghurt drink i had was a little too light in flavour and consistency. the beef in the gyu don waa slightly dry and stiff, and the gyu don itself was a little under sauced. happy to see the pickled ginger, edamame and pieces of fruit on it though. the egg in granny's gyu don was only slightly juicy and mine was hardly so. granny had ginger fruit tea which smelled great and tasted good.  careful with the grains and flakes in it though.  they tickled granny's throat. the server told me they no longer have mochi so i was a moderately disappointed because a large portion of their dessert menu is therefore rendered obsolete. portion may not be enough to feed a guy for dinner. they only have two ice cream flavours--macha and taro. i tried the macha one and the flavour was good.",3
"my boyfriend always comes to this location to get his haircut. sometimes i tag along. the ladies are always fun to talk to and happened to talk me into getting my haircut today along with my boyfriend. lindsay cut my hair and haifa cut my boyfriend's hair. he always looks amazing, and lindsay did a great job and kept me laughing the whole time! thank you ladies!",5
"i enjoy good food and good happy hour specials, and el segundo has them both. i have gone to eat here several times, mostly for happy hour, and have only been just a little bit disappointed. just a smidge.

happy hour: truly one of the best on the strip. great food selection (go straight to the chicken, pork or beef tacos, do not pass go), margaritas are delicious, not too sweet, not bland or watered down with mix. service is good each time we go to el segundo. we love the nachos, not too much cheese, love the jalepenos for that extra kick without being too aggressive. get the crab tostada. real crab, not heavy on the mayo or dressing, perfect. yum. now. hh gives you food in the perrfect size. it is a great hh, and perfect for a few quick bites to refuel while running amock on the strip.

inside restaurant: now here is where my desire to give only three stars comes into play. since i was so used to the delicious street tacos and nacos and oh yes, that crab tostada i was a little displeased with the restaurant fare. i strongly dislike, borderline hate overcooked food. i've done it before, but that was in the privacy of my own home and rarely at a restaurant. the shrimp was very overcooked. disappointed, especially since the shrimp were plump and looked delicious sitting on the fajita plate. maybe it sat for too long? heat lamp cooking? i got my way through it by smothering the shrimp with their delicious cilantro rice (seriously, i could have eaten a copious amount of that rice) and beans. however, the next time i came back and had the chicken tacos? same thing. dry. oh, i just don't think that dry chicken should ever be served to a table. if someone could say the food on their plate is dry, do not serve it. even by looking at it i could see that it was dry.

however, between their killer happy hour and their amazing amazing amazinga tableside guacamole, i'm confident in the 4 stars here. go for hh, get some guacamole, chips and salsa, nachos with chicken, crab tostada and some street tacos and you'll be good to go until later that night when you're struggling to hold down the contents of your stomach after one too many hurricanes.",4
"great spaghetti and meatballs, good service and reasonable prices , not too impressed with the baked clams, but everything else was good",4
"soooo much fun!! one of my favorite shows in vegas.  lots of talent and silliness. it is important to know what you are getting into.  i think the reviews on the more negative side are folks who don't know what to expect. it is an adult show.  it is the more casual sensual side of cirque.  the mc, a lovely drag queen, is just fantastic!  so funny with so much personality.  i have been twice and already have my next trip scheduled. 
i say i didnt have nearly as much fun in the balcony.  if you are going to go, unlike the other cirque shows that allow for seating farther away, pay the money and sit closer.  it isn't just about the nudity but the fact that it is a more intimate show and a more intimate venue.  i sat in the balcony the first time and kooky-loos 4 rows ahead blocked my view, second time i was in the second row and my appreciation was 10 fold!",5
"i went in on a very hot las vegas day and was craving something cool and refreshing. i went in and was immediately greeted by the very friendly staff. 
i ended up ordering a thai iced tea and a green tea crepe cake. the tea was perfect-not too sweet, not too strong. the crepe cake was beautifully presented, with a tiny saucer of green tea sauce (amazing when poured over vanilla ice cream), and a small portion of fresh fruit. 10\/10 would go again and recommend to a friend",5
salads today.  caesar and greek.  one with salmon and the other with grilled shrimp.  they've got a beautiful crisp rose not on the menu which goes perfectly with the shrimp.,4
"friendly baristas, relaxed and warm atmosphere, natural lighting, loose leaf rishi tea, vosges and other chocolate, some good gift options-- overall a lovely place to spend the afternoon!",5
had great food tonight. food was very fresh. service was good. very pleasant for a quick meal. good value for the price.,5
"these guys are fantastic.  i don't know what they did and my home just felt ""cleaner"" than when others did it.",5
love the atmosphere .. old time diner decor. i've been coming here on and off for years. some food is good and some not but there's lots to choose from. my son swears this is the best burger he's ever tried (and we go burger hunting). he also loves the fries and milkshakes. i love the all day breakfast. my other son craves the pancakes that smell oh so good.,4
"like others, i heard of the coffee cup on diners, drive-ins, and dives and decided to try it out. once inside the decor is very upbeat, from old license plates in the back, ski's on the walls, water sports pictures all over, and just an overall great casual feeling. when we went there was no line, and we had some okay service. at times i felt like i was bothering the waitress to simply ask for some sugar for my coffee or what not.

with this being said the food was delicious. i ordered the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on a croissant. the croissant was nicely toasted, and the flavors were great. the meal also came with hash browns, which were golden and delicious.

overall, great food for a great price! i would recommend it to families and couples that are just looking for a budgeted meal full of amazing flavor.",4
"got the taro milk tea, blended, with boba. delicious and comparable to the great boba places i go to in california. hard to find at first, but near the movie theater in the back. free wifi, just ask for the password. seating is a bit limited though and there's only a few wall outlets if you're trying to come here to do work.",5
"dayclub! dayclub! dayclub!

i love the dayclub!

the dayclub is unlike any experience i've ever had in vegas. it is kooky, off the wall, and i love that it's not a ""scene."" no one is trying to act too cool. everyone is there just to be silly, dance, drink, and have a blast. there was a minion, a dude dressed as captain america, go go dancers in unicorn masks, an astronaut helmet, the works. free champagne for ladies the first hour. you can be dressed up, or not. doesn't seem to matter if you have typical club attire or just your everyday clothing. it was a little slow and empty at first, but around 3pm it got super packed. then everyone went cray in the best way possible. it had a really great mix of music too that seemed to please everyone: hip hop, top 40, edm. they never lingered too long on one genre which was nice!

and this is coming from a woman who thought she was over clubbing completely. really, i am over it, but this felt like a crazy fun house party more than a club. 

oh, i also drank a 40 and twerked on that minion. 

amaze!",5
i got the mussels here.... big mistake!!! cool atmosphere. i shouldn't have listened to my boss' food recommendation.,1
"this place is definitely a gem along the yonge st. strip in richmond hill that recently opened.  the menu serves extensive dishes typical to a congee house (wide array of dishes outside of just congee so do not be put off by the name of the restaurant), so there is something yummy for everyone.  the place itself has a large interior and well spaced tables and booths for people to be seated comfortably, not much in terms of decor but again, congee places usually do not pride themselves on expensive decor either.  service is average at best, but usually congee places are speedy and efficient with bringing food which is what people like about them. if you are looking for top notch customer service, do not expect it here, especially with very reasonably priced (read: cheap) menu items that are well-portioned.

my favourites include:

1. bbq pork drizzled in honey (you can get the combo dish with rice and veggies for around $6) and the portion is massive

2. congee with preserved egg and shredded pork

3. spicy fried turnip cakes 

4. sizzling salmon fish head served in hot pot

the food is fresh and looks clean, the taste is much better than other congee houses in the area.  they also have special during afternoon tea time (ends at 5pm), and if you are going for dinner, they serve free dessert afterwards to each person.  the desserts range (depending on what day of the week you go) from sweet red bean soup, hot mango sago soup, and the small sticky rice balls cooked in hot rice wine and sugar water. usually the desserts are served hot, which is perfect for this time of the year when the weather is getting chilly.",4
"they didn't win best florists in the valley for nothing! barb was extremely helpful and professional. i had a pretty good idea of what kind of flowers i wanted for my wedding. i came into the shop knowing i wanted a professional florist to create my bridal bouquet and would just purchase flowers from another cheap florist to put my bridesmaids bouquets together myself in order to save some money. barb offered great ideas on the bridesmaids bouquets for affordable prices. i was so pleased with her ideas and low prices i ended up ordering all my wedding flowers from them rather than making arrangements myself. they saved me the time, money and effort i would have otherwise put into it myself had i done it all diy. everyone there was so curteous. they even invited me to come in the day before my wedding to look at the flowers and make sure i was happy with everything. i wanted something very colorful and fall like for my bouquet and barbara created the most beautiful bouquet. it turned out a lot better than i expected! 

they are not limited to weddings either. they offer flower and arrangement delivery for special occassions as well. my husband, who is a romantic that sends me flowers quite often just because already has their number saved in his phone. i can't wait to receive another beautiful creation from them again! truly a delight!",5
"this was our first stop of the day. really wanted to try an old fashioned but felt it too early in the day. (""too early?"" wtf??? i know!) went with a mimosa instead and that hit the spot. 

i heard the cheese curds here were the best, so had to try them of course. what i heard turned out to be true. effin delicious! probably not the healthiest way to start a day, but who cares! 

had the breakfast sandwich too. english muffin was much more dense than i expected but it was really good. the egg was perfectly cooked and when the yolk broke all over, what a delicious mess that ended up being. 

next time, an old fashioned for me. and please, more cheese curds!",5
"i like this place for a quick drink on my way to somewhere else, mainly because it is such a beautiful building, as the title suggests there are a lot of tiles. 
i used to have lunches there when i worked in the area and always liked them, the problem was alwyas making myself go back to work after them. 
it is really awkward getting seat at times - i am very small and the big seats by the windows make me look like onhe of the borrowers, and it can be a hassle getting served as well when the bar is busy which is what makes me thinks of this bar as either a start or end of night venue - not a place to spend the whole night.",3
"stopped for food after a nice horse ride. host was rude sat us then accused us of seating ourselves. not apologetic after providing our name on the list. ordered a steak and was charged for a more expensive one, server said i ate it so i was paying for it. not what i ordered but ok. luke warm, bland food, scammy tourist trap.",1
"wer ein fan von achterbahnen und themenparks ist, darf bei einem besuch in montreal nicht am park la ronde vorbei gehendenn er sollte gleich mal reingehen :-)


 la ronde gehört zur amerikanische six flags gruppe, bekannt für die höchsten und spannensten achterbahnen.


 auch in montreal wird man nicht enttäuscht. einige achterbahnen locken mit tollen loopings und schnellen kurven. hightlight ist natürlich eine originale holzachterbahn


 nachteil ist auf jeden fall die lieblose gestaltung des parks. langweilige geteerte strassen führen zu den attraktionen. alles ist realtiv einfach und langweilig inszeniert. ganz im gegenteil zu z.b. europäischen freizeitparks die verschiedene themen aufzeigen durch bepflanzungen, häuser usw.


 wie gesagt, der park ist nur was für achterbahnfreaksnicht wirklich etwas für familien. der eintrittspreis ist auch dementsprechend hoch und die gastronomie im park beschränkt sich auf langweiliges fastfood (pizza, hot dog und mc donalds).


 falls man sich doch für einen besuch entscheidet, sollte man das auf jeden fall unter der woche machen. ausserhalb von feiertagen und schulferien. sonst steht man stundenlang an den attraktionen an und der spaß vergeht sehr schnell.",3

for the full review and pics go to http:\/\/www.kats9lives.com\/2008\/09\/so-much-better.html

the pool there is awesome! it's breath-takingly beautiful and i just feel relaxed looking at it.  tonight my pal was telling me about the wonderful food she had at japonaise.  got to go back to get some of that!

i will tell you why i liked the mirage... we stayed in a suite at the luxor on the weekend and switched over here on the weekdays.  omg! the luxor suites is crap! a rip off! i was in disbelief at how much we paid for such a horridly ugly room that lacked a good ac unit.  the room was tiny and dim unlike the mirage.  i stayed at the venetian before the luxor.  it seriously was falling from grace! i would rather stay at a cheap motel then spend 3x to 4x as much on a lame suite.

the mirage was a blessing after the luxor.  i loved the room's decor.  it was clean and refreshing.  i can't stop raving about them.  sure it's no venetian, but for the price... heck yah! i will take it any day for the price i got.  

only thing i have to say that sucked was they are still under construction and every morning we would hear them drilling.  of course it woke us up early, so big minus! but other than that... great! ^_^",4
"4 stars for breakfast.  3 stars for lunch and dinner.   the biggest problem i've encountered, like many yelpers have reviewed before me, are the lack of organization and slow service.   the single-file, cafeteria style line just doesn't seem to cut it.  workers seem confused as to who to serve next at times; often people get skipped only to slow down service even further.  it's a claustrophobic clusterf-... never mind.  breakfast lines are more manageable.

during breakfast, at a whopping $3.95, you are provided with two sunnyside-up eggs, two generous scoops of garlic fried rice (which i believe in the fine print of an ad i saw that it is actually unlimited rice?) and your choice of breakfast entree.  these include corned beef, 2 kinds of longanisa (filipino sausages- sweet, pork-filled), various fried fish, tocino (filipino bacon pretty much, yummy), and other choices based on the day.  coffee is free.  i love to literally pig out after a long nightshift at work.

i've tried what they apparently specialize in for lunch and dinner, that which is their chicken and pork bbq.  while not bad tasting, they will not channel your inner food-child to come back for more.  the bbq are definitely not worth waiting for in the amusement park-like lines.    

but as i said before, do come for breakfast.  you should get your money and your tummy's worth.  and tell them that mike sent ya.   you won't get any special treatment.  but you will get looked at funny. =)

love the healthy choices. food was large portions. service was very friendly and quick. no complaints other than the prices are a little steep for a deli.  have eaten there a few times and will go back. love that they update the menu often with fresh ideas. even the soups are on point.,5

"we went to ebc at night with a-trak which was pretty fun! there were a few people in nightclub wear (which was kind of weird) but mostly everyone were in swimwear... i love the fact i didn't have to wear high heels that night! woo.

the area is pretty big, with three big pools, but they only allowed us to go in two pools that night, haha. there were plenty of things to do, like a large connect four game, giant foam jenga, basketball, bunch of floaties, also a small dance floor in front of the dj and two large bars. there are tables and lily pads all around the area but plenty of other seating if you are a baller on a budget like i am. i was kind of surprised of how not crowded it was (during the day ebc always looks crazy packed), but no complaints from me because everyone was chill and we all had a fun time. by 3 am, it was almost empty.

one thing i should note is how crazily thorough security can be... they checked everything, i mean everything. they checked the inside of my lip balm and the inside of each card sleeve of my wallet, haha! so be careful you sneaky party people!

overall, ebc night was fun! i'll have to check it out during the day next summer.",4
"chinese $ mexican!!! 2 cuisines that are usually peoples favorite. i've been here once and let me tell you, great stuff. i went here with about 10 people and they all loved it. especially the red jade chicken.....awesome. the emerald chicken in a quesadilla was also a favorite. make sure you order the black beans and the jerk fried rice. seriously don't forget. i do have to say it is kinda weird being served in a aluminium foil bowl, but who gives a s%$t, the food in it is good. i will come here everytime i visit my bro in the big az. peace.",4
"tea is tea is tea. this used to be the tea leaf where you could choose your mixture of leaves seen in glass, apothecary-like jars lining the walls. you could also buy the most delectable strawberry and raspberry tarts to accompany your hot tea and drink your sorrows away.

fast forward to today and david's tea now stands in replacement, with a room brightly lit like a surgeon's room. the walls are white, clean, and cold. the concept is the same where teas are separated by black, green, roibos, etc...labels are big so that there is no confusion between the cranberry pear or the alpine punch. i was here with my dad and we decided to sit and have a cup. fyi - seating is very limited to three small tables of two seaters. long is gone of the comfy booth and table seats of the tea leaf. david's isn't for you to really sit and be philosophical, but rather, get in, buy, get out. 

the thing that i was annoyed with is that if you want to buy tea to drink on the spot, you could potentially be standing in line for 30 minutes as the two staff members are busy explaining the history of china's black tea revolution and how 5 tea leaves could really open up your sinuses. riveting. the person in front of me thought so too as she generously bought a sample for $2. i am probably not their target market (the buy a cup and dash), but come on! can't there be someone dedicated to making cups of tea? i bought two teas (aka, tea bags) and i had to fork over $5 and change...take that for sample! 

if there was no one in line, i would definitely stop by and try a different tea. the water is nice and hot and really brings out the flavours. on the other hand, don't bother standing in line if all you want is a cup. head over to timothy's or lettieri and just be satisfied with a regular orange pekoe.

i get my asian\/green tea's from asian tea places (i am a sucker for the tea ceremonies...), so don't think i would be coming back here for those leaves. on the other hand, this could be a great stop for gifts for tea aficionado's who like tea's to have whimsical names. this location also sells some beautiful tea-wares such as a wood and glass hand-held tea bottle with its own leaf strainer built in. ikea watch out!",3
"went here with a group of friends to find out what all the hype was about. maybe it's because i just moved from a place where restaurants like this are a dime a dozen, but i really didn't get what all the fuss was about. 

we were seated on time and had no issues with the service. started our meal with a charcuterie board (this was the best thing we ordered, definitely worth getting!!) and the pork belly appetizer. the pork belly was good but not great. didn't quite melt in your mouth, was a bit rubbery feeling.

for the entree i ordered a seasonal special of smoked chicken. again, good not great. my fiance got the flank steak which i had a bite of. wish i had ordered that. another person with us had the dirty pasta which everyone raved about but i didn't try.

rounded out dinner by sharing three desserts: cheesecake, apple pie, and and smores. the smores and apple pie were very good. cheesecake was meh. 

for a total bill of $150 for two people and an average dinner, won't be back any time soon. not worth it for the money in my opinion.",3
"vua"" is the vietnamese word for king, and this restaurant lives up to that name. i grew up in toronto, now live in the us east coast, even ate banh mi in vietnam - and vua ranks very close to the top banh mi i've ever had (so take my review seriously because i'm not some clueless american tourist who is new to banh mi). 

service:  very friendly and the vietnamese staff not only speak vietnamese, they can take your order in french and english. one day i came in right at opening time and was told by the cashier that sandwiches weren't yet available, but when she saw our disappointment she went back and called the kitchen staff to have them make us sandwiches. what sweethearts! there are a few tables inside near the door, a very small terrasse with some more tables, and a shared indoor dining space with thai express (but is located one floor above thai express, or two floors above vua). 

general comment: the sandwiches are loaded with liver pate and housemade soy sauce which is how it's supposed to be done in vietnam. this ain't your typical lazy banh mi shop in north america that uses bottled soy sauce and acts stingy on pate content. this means your sandwich will drip an oozy mixture of mayo and soy sauce so watch your clothing, but don't despair - only the most legit banh mi will drip in this manner. also the bread gets toasted before all the other ingredients go in, and ends up with a crispy exterior and fluffy interior. 

#1 dac biet sandwich: loaded with vietnamese deli meats, some pate, and priced 50c less than every other sandwich. amazing value and beautifully balanced flavor with the pickled vegetables. 
#12 liver pate sandwich: no deli meats here, just a massive gob of pate along with the pickled vegetables. it looks frightening to see how much pate they use, and i was so unbelievably excited when i saw them pack in this amount of flavor.

side note, after 9pm the prepared foods (usually between $7-8) are an additional 30% off - this includes delicious plates of fried rice, steamed rice with grilled meat, and\/or stir fried noodles. they just need to be reheated.
overall, absolutely solid and authentic banh mi shop in a cute and conveniently located neighborhood, i'm sure to return next time i'm in mtl.
last comment (i promise): $5 credit card minimum.",5
"incredibly good service in a beautiful historic setting. bring your appetite for the tasting menu,  it's a lot and very rich. excellent new (for me) and creative dishes. wesley running the wine pairings is also tremendous.",5
went for happy hour yesterday to have a taste from their menu. happy hour was at the too small of a bar. the bar tender had way too much to manage and it seemed to be a slow night.  they would not serve us on their absolutely beautiful peaceful patio surrounded by waterfalls and a lake full of koi. it's the best part of what they have to offer and we were stuck at the bar.  but we went outside after putting up with the marginal food......the patio could not make up for the food but we enjoyed it very much but why not open up your best asset? the hawthorne grill was way better,3
"mymy chicken有一班又年輕態度友善的韓國男女侍應，音樂是比較大聲的酒吧形式。前菜有自家制新鮮出爐的爆谷。試了golden cheese 炸鷄係用比較light同比較鬆化的炸粉炸脆而成。炸的火候恰好，炸雞有令人見到就垂涎三尺的金黃色。外面的炸粉薄，脆而鬆，但鷄肉又剛剛熟透，所以鷄肉多汁又唔覺得太油膩。唯獨係cheese比較少。

要一提的是mymy chicken的價錢比其他韓式炸雞店最少貴五至六元，我覺得味道、 材料份量都同其他韓國炸鷄店差唔多，值唔值得就見人見智。還有，所有唔係住附近步行距離的顧客仲要搵位俾錢泊車。計埋條數，比起其他有自己parking嘅餐廳最後最少要比多十蚊。如果想慳幾蚊泊車錢，就九點後嚟啦。",4
after having a disastrous experience with my normal hair dresser where i ended up with a mix of cookie monster blue and chlorine green hair. i was left feeling hopeless and frustrated until i contacted maria who assured me everything would be okay and set me up with her first available appointment with the lovely melanie. melanie was personable and kind and most importantly she fixed my hair! all i had wanted were some steel gray\/silver peek a boos and when i left today thats what i had. she was honest with me and walked me through the whole process as we went along. hair color xperts definitely has a new client for life. thank you!,5
"kann ich alles nur bestätigen. als ehemalige dönerverweigerin fällt mein urteil vielleicht noch mehr ins gewicht?!
also das fleisch ist wirklich als solches zu erkennen (keine pampe, wie bei den meisten anderen dönerbuden)und schmeckt sehr gut. auch die teureren gerichte wie sis kebap (gegrillte fleischspieße mit beilagen) oder iskender sind sehr zu empfehlen. vielleicht ein bissle teurer im vergleich zur konkurrenz, aber sehr lohnenswert. wer noch hunger hat sollte mal den süßen nachtisch probieren :)

the best restaurant in vegas try to go early or you will wait a long time but it is so worth it if you can't make it early the portions are huge so i suggest you share my two favorite plates are the biscuits and gravy with egg and fried chicken mixed in and the chorizo hash the service is always awesome  this restaurant is always a must eat every time i come to vegas,5
"stopped here today for a quick lunch during a 2-hour layover at phx. i got a grilled chicken taco on a flour tortilla, minus the queso and beans, and a shredded beef taco on a corn tortilla. i had figured the corn one would be a hard shell but it was actually soft shell. 

the tacos were pretty good, a little pricey (around $11-12) but that's typical for airport food. it has a limited seating area but i found a seat at the bar, there are a few tables to sit at as well.",4
"this is another spot i go to for good deals... accessories, shoes, dresses, knick-knacks for the house, etc! this store is organized fairly well and is always clean. the selection is usually pretty good (but rainbow and 215 is better.) granted i have to be in a mood to go through the racks and racks of stuff (but they do have some small displays for featured items.)  other than that i will be back and would recommend!",4

"after cruising through yelp for local italian restaurant suggestions, we read the reviews for north beach italian bistro and i decided to give it a go. so glad i did! we were an international group, ok, just one frenchman, and four americans. the wonderful entrees were enhanced by the lovely service. in one visit this place is our favorite dining experience for northwest las vegas. loved it!",5

"just went and bought a crib today for my little girl. i spoke with dee on the phone before going in. she was very quick with finding out what i needed, and checking their stock for me. dee, natasha, and phoenix were all so great. what started with a bad experience with a different employee, turned out to be the best experience because of these lovely ladies. natasha was very quick to help us when told that the other employee had given us incorrect information. they were very friendly, super helpful, and downright hilarious. they knew what they were talking about immediately. they made it the best experience i've ever had at babies r us. it was even the best experience i've had at a store period. i would definitely recommend this location to anyone.",5
"went to brazz for a buddy's birthday.  i only had chima to compare it to.  the salad bar\/hot bar didn't come close to chima's, but as everyone says, you're not going there for the salad or soups.  all the meats were good.  the sirloin was the best.  the gator, the worst.  i'm not a scallops fan, so saying they were bad wouldn't be fair.  between here and chima, i'd give the edge to chima b\/c the prices are basically the same, but you get more options at chima, and it feels a bit more upscale.  bottom line, you're looking at $60\/per person night.  would i go back, yes, if someone was paying for me.  otherwise, i'd go to chima.",3
"dana brown,

at this time the pool deal has been taken care of.

james had come over to take care of the timer for the sprinklers twice.  first time the amount of run time was set wrong.  i talked to him about it and he came back and reset it again but we ended up with the same problem. the sprinklers don't shut off according to the timer and james had it set right.  he had everything set for 4 minutes but my back yard was flooded and i had flash flood warning going out from the frye family house in the front yard so the timer is shut off.  that needs to be taken care of please.

joe has been out and has taken care of a few things.  we got 2 garage door openers, the leaky faucet in the downstairs bathroom, fixed the front door which now shuts and opens great but now we have daylight coming through the bottom thresh hold. the back splash by the kitchen sink still needs to be sealed.  the screen door of the back sliding door needs new screening and the sliding door still needs to have new rollers or something so the door slides open easier. joe had mentioned to my wife he had to order parts.  i'm assuming for the sliding door.  looking for follow up on where that stands please.  also the fireplace does not work.

on the ac system when you have dirt build up on the registers and the wall.  that is saying the coils are very dirty from the lack of filter changing and maintenance has not happened.  when i changed the filters one of the filters had actually been sucked apart. i have pictures of the filters. we can't wait till the fall for this to be done.  my electric bill will be much higher than it should be and the increase of equipment failure is much higher. i paid a deposit plus for a move in ready rental home in a nice area not in south phoenix.  

i sent pictures of the landscape of the trash.  i seen the property before the landscapers were there and after. lawn in the backyard was never mowed and the weeds just got bigger after the rain your right but the trash never blew in it was from the previous tenant.  the weeds and trash had been taken care of already that bothered me to much to wait. but i would like the landscapers to come in and make the yard look good as it should have been prior to moving in and i am responsible for it from than on.

bottom line is reading over your contract i am responsible for alot of the issues listed above. so i expect to move in to a clean and maintained property. now if you tell me the shape of the property is in when i moved in is exceptionable to where i get my deposit back in full i just need that in writing from you.

i also have received my first rent bill, on the bill it stats payment is due by the 12th.  i am looking for clarification on this.  is it the first of the month or is it by the 12th of the month.
 
at this point am not impressed with the attention to detail, customer service.  it seems like collect the money and ignore the problems hoping i will go away. 

thanks,

"we were seated within 5 minutes, just in time to order 1\/2 price appetizers.  

for some reason, our table didn't  have the ""pay at your table""\/game-play things.  i asked for one and they quickly complied.  (i hate waiting\/paying for a check.)  they dropped it off and informed us there is a charge to play the games (i knew this already as i like to play the quizes-obviously i dont know my spouse very well....i always guess the wrong thing, bahawaaa)

we ordered the appetizer combo-happy hour 50% off.  it was 5:45pm.  correct price on the check (yippy)and totally delicious.  they even brought the correct bleu cheese dip. so many places get that wrong but not here.

we ordered the 2\/$20 whiskey burger with fries.  my husband thought the meat needed more seasoning.  i took a bite and i thought the combination of the whiskey bbq steak sauce, crunchy onions, bacon, and cheese was incredible.  with all the mixture of flabors, the meat doesn't need a great deal of extra ""umph.""  ehat i liked about the burger was the little bit of ""crisp"" surrounding the meat pattie

as for my meal.  the chicken with white sauce covered with crunchy onions, baked tator and i got a ""premium"" side of bacon mac-n- cheese (at an extra charge.)  i think i like the mac-n-cheese the best.  very cheesy with a creamy sauce, add in the cruch of the bacon-home run.  as for the chicken....not sure how they managed it but it was both rubbery and moist.  i took most of it home for leftovers.  ""lunch tomorrow!""  not sure if for me or my dog....depends how good it is.  but hey, the dog eats anything...including my shoes and hair brush. :)

the waiter we had was awesome.  did everything right.  checked on us often but not too often to be a pest.  was friendly without being flirty.  sometimes im in the mood to be ""chatty"" but tonight we were in a hurry.  it was time to bowl so he quickly brought boxes.  as he was bagging up the meal, i was paying for the meal.  multi-tasking.....i love it.  

overall, 4 stars.  only due to the rubbery chicken.  no real complaints and we had a wonderful meal.  will go again.",4
"i was impressed by the good reviews, but the experience was anything but five star. i wanted to give one star but the decor is really nice.

the soup was old and cold. too much white rice without much taste. it would taste much better with some spices. 

i asked for a mixed kafta but one of the brochette is old for sure. you can tell the difference between the two brochette from the look and smell. i asked the waiter why they are different but did not care much. 

it might be my bad luck or their bad day. however, i do not think i will bet on another chance.",2
"dirty.  dirty, dirty, dirty.   i was excited to have a corner suite at aria, but i sat on my couch and pulled a pair of dirty women's underwear out from under a couch cushion.  then, in the awesome bathroom, i dropped my hairbrush on the floor, and when i bent down to get it, there were 4 xanax on the floor, under the vanity.  neither of the above items were mine; we had just checked in.  i asked to change rooms and a room upgrade, and they told me that would be difficult.  they put an equal room on hold for me, but i couldn't get into it until 6pm the following day.   really more of a hassle to move rooms.  then, later in my stay, as i was walking from the shower to my room, i sliced the bottom of my foot open on a carpet staple\/nail that was loose.  hurts like hell.   since i had already officially ""checked out"" online early that morning, they wouldn't do anything about that.   for all of this, in a 48 hour stay, after talking with the management for a day and a half, they finally offered me a $100 credit on anything inside the hotel.  $100 does not buy 1 show ticket, or 1 spa treatment.  i still had to spend more money there.   i could not use $100 on food, since i was at a work conference. some bs if you ask me.  i will not return to the aria, would not recommend it, and will not stay there next year, if the conference is there again.",1
love it! great food every time even if it's not close to the house. great service and consistent.,5
"the piercing went fine, no issues, but the shop and the people running it were not the most welcoming. 

i made an appointment, and showed up 15 min early, but the owner\/piercer was running behind, and took his time chatting with the previous client, who was friends with everyone in the shop. at first, i thought this was a great sign, because he seemed caring and friendly. but, after finishing her piercing, he lingered, went out for a cigarette with a friend that stopped by, and ended up being 45 min late to my appointment, in an otherwise empty shop. 

the woman behind the counter didn't make me feel comfortable when i was choosing my post for the piercing, and was trying to talk me into something a little bit fancier\/more expensive than i ideally wanted. while it is helpful to have someone as a guide, it made me uneasy with her standing and waiting while i looked at the display cases. 

once the owner\/piercer called me back, he didn't try to chat with me. at all. didn't attempt to make me feel comfortable. he didn't even explain the process of what he was going to do and how it was going to happen, where i've always had the experience of a piercer either talking me through step by step where in the process they are, or trying to chat with me so that i am calm\/distracted. 

i am happy that he was a good piercer, but the environment and people didn't make me feel welcome or comfortable, so i will not be returning for my future piercings.",3

"one can only come here in the morning or early afternoon, otherwise they'd run out of their excellent pastries.

coffee was just so-so.  had a latte, espresso was alright but the foam is just weak and not velvety like it was supposed to be.  at $4 i really expected better.

i really wish they would extend their pastry availability and hours till midnight.  even with underwhelming coffee i'd still go hang out with friends there at night.

at the moment i don't go often, as it is not worth going after 3pm -- no more pastry, just subpar expensive coffee left, and it closes at 7pm.",3
"fine dining...sort of? if you're not familiar, this place is the chain from don shula the famous football coach. the prices are up there with some of the other big name steak houses, delmonico's, morton's ruth's chris, etc. we were staying at the hotel so we tried it. 

it's fine dining service, very professional, mixed with a fantasy football man-cave. steak menu written on a football in the middle of the table and wall to wall football photos. 

the service was excellent. i wasn't impressed with the food at all. tasteless. from beginning to end. the only thing that stood out is the fried squid. good appetizer that i can get at tgi fridays. steak was cooked right, it just wasn't all that good. desert was terrible. for nearly $300.00 it isn't worth it. i realize if you're stuck in the hotel, you don't really have that many choice but there is a mall just down the street surrounded by better restaurants. the cab fair is worth it to find a better place to dine.",2
"decided to try the place out after reading all the positive feedback... ordered sesame chicken with rice, orange chicken with rice and a chicken lo main .. all the dishes tasted the same and very bland .. the lo main was very overcooked .. the chicken was pretty good in all the dishes but just so bland ... i mean no flavors what's so ever .. why the big hype about this place, i don't know ..",3

i  really miss this place since we moved to california. it is owned by a lovely couple who treat you as though you are their only guest even when they are really busy. the shrimp korma is my fave and my husband favors their chicken tikka masala. i can also never say no to there aloo gobi. definitely worth checking out.,5
"ever since i moved back to cleveland from chicago, i have been on the quest for some kind of suitable substitute for chicago style pizza. when i heard guy's offered chicago style pizza i knew i had to try it. i attempted to order just cheese and they told me i had to pick 4 ingredients minimum for it to work. immediately, i knew that it was not going to be real chicago style pizza, but rather some kind of stuffed pizza deal that they decided to call chicago style. disappointing, but i still wanted to try. i ordered black olives, mushrooms, extra cheese and onions. when my pizza arrived i took a bite only to discover pineapple inside as well. disgusting! the pizza was a sloppy, mushy pile of crap and basially not edible. i threw it away and called to complain. after arguing with a manager for 5 minutes, he agreed to give me a free pizza. a month later i ordered a regular pizza with black olives. when it came, the crust was mushy and not fully cooked. the sauce wasn't even that warm. this pizza was also not fit for human consumption, so we pitched it. i will never ever order from here again.",1
"raku is located off the famed las vegas strip, but it is worth the trip. i would recommend getting a reservation as the restaurant gets quite busy.  do not let the strip mall location of raku fool you. the prices at raku are not strip mall prices. it is a pricey restaurant, but the quality justifies the price. 

we ordered a a few items from the robata grill. while all of the items that we ordered were excellent, the kobe beef was the standout.  i would highly recommend the kobe beef. 

we also ordered udon noodles and oyako don. both of these dishes were excellent.  we tried their daily special sashimi. it was fresh and melted in my mouth. 

for drinks, we ordered two sake samplers. the servers were very knowledgeable about sake. the samplers allowed us to taste various sake that we would otherwise not have had the opportunity to sample. the sake also paired well with our meal. delicious.  

i would highly recommend raku if you love robata grills and sake.",5
"it's shameful when a steakhouse can't make a good burger. 

had a kobe burger here on the recommendation of another yelper, daisy t. what a mistake!

it's clear that daisy hasn't had a lot of kobe burgers before, because boa's burger is as bland and forgettable as it gets. clearly they use purchased patties...they're too perfectly-shaped to be house-ground. even the condiments and the bun (usually the most forgotten part of the burger experience) were kind of mediocre. 

for a great burger, kobe or otherwise, you're better off at burger bar, lbs, in & out, fatburger...or if you want one of the best burgers in town, bradley ogden.",1
"we had a group reservation for the old town tortilla factory, that was great. the problem was that was about all that was great about the place. the credit card machine in the bar was down for the time we were waiting for our table, chips and salsa was $7 and the food was not really good at all. i had asked our waitress about two items and she suggested the restaurants signature dish pollo margarita, stuffed chicken breast with chiptole mashed potato cake and seasonal vegetables. the chicken was extremely dry the stuffing was bland and the mashed potato cake was the same bland and dry. the only thing good to eat was the freshly made tortillas.",2
for an easy to go pizza this place is fantastic; they experiment with different flavors and have no issues making any changes to your choice of pie.,5
"i ate here a few saturday nights ago with my girlfriend for dinner.  i have been coming here for the past five years or so, more often than not for their bubble tea and have only ever eaten here once before.  the inside of the restaurant is fairly small but not overly crowded which is nice.  on one side of the restaurant is an enclosed counter where you can order food to go or watch them make the bubble tea and the rest of the restaurant is made up of tables and chairs.

for my dinner entrée i decided to have something a little different than my normal selections and went with the chicken and broccoli in a black pepper sauce.  whenever the dish came out it looked exactly as i would have expected with some broccoli and chicken in a dark brown sauce that had visible pepper in it and side of rice.  the sauce was good but not nearly as spicy as i was expecting based upon the little chili pepper that was next to it on the menu.  it paired well with the chicken and broccoli and i ended up thoroughly enjoying my meal.  i especially enjoyed that my broccoli was cooked just right and was crispy instead of being overcooked and mushy.  my girlfriend also enjoyed her meal which was the eggplant in garlic sauce.  her eggplant was also cooked nicely and the sauce was very similar to the one that i had except instead of the pepper it seemed to have a nice garlic flavor.  before we left i also ordered a large green lemon bubble tea which i enjoyed on the way home.  they always seem to make it perfectly with a not too sweet flavor that goes well with the citrus and ample amounts of tapioca pearls at the bottom which get you through the entire drink.

the bottom line for me is that i will definitely head back here in the future.  with how good my food tasted i can see myself coming here more often and not just because i love the bubble tea.",5

"i came here because it was a closer peking duck restaurant in north york.

the interior was dingy and interesting. i can't think of a word to pinpoint my feelings towards the mauve patterned walls with oriental dolls and fish tanks as decoration. additionally, my friend made a reservation for us but they didn't seem to have it in their books - possibly because she made it in english. you could say we started off on the wrong foot.

once we got seated, she asked the waiter if we could get chrysanthemum tea. he agreed and to our disappointment, we were served green tea instead. i wish they didn't agree to giving it to us if they didn't have it\/didn't understand english. throughout our dinner, i felt as though we were ignored for the rest of dinner compared to the other tables because of the communication barrier. i'm sure it will be a better experience if you can speak mandarin. this could also have been because it was very busy night.

the duck was good and food itself was fine. unfortunately, the service we had ruined our experience.",2
"defiantly worth the hype! for drinks i ordered the sangria and my bf got the two ipa's on draft.  my sangria was good came in a glass mason jar.  my boyfriend enjoyed both ipa's. 

appetizer we ordered the q rolls tasty deep fried brisket with a bbq dipping sauce and spicy dipping sauce as well-i enjoyed the bbq as it was a little sweet how i like it!

main course we split the prime rib & bbq chicken combo.  combo comes with a potato and two sides.  we ordered the mac and cheese and oh my god it was prob the best mac and cheese i've had in a while---five stars alone!!!!. the other side was the veggies...eh wasn't a fan . the veggies they chose were onions? squash and peppers, to me that just wasn't what i was expecting- i had in mind broccoli or cauliflower? seemed like an odd choice 

for  dessert we ordered the mud pie to go !

as a bonus they give you some homemade donuts for the road ( i was too stuffed but my bf said they were amazing)

overall good pick, good music, and good service! will be back for sure!",5

"this place is okay. i'm not sure what the big hooplah is. sure they have some stinking hot guys and girls working the pool but besides that i'm not sure what else they have going for them. if your definition of wild and crazy is stupid guys splashing in the pool like little children then by all means, this is the pool for you! some idiot was splashing water at a security guy while he was setting some other dbag straight and he eventually got kicked out. come on people, grow up. we're all adults here. on top of that, there was what seemed like a horrible rap video gone wrong. people were laughing at them but i think those girls thought everyone was thinking how cool they were. somewhere between all of that there was an older white lady, nice body, who took off her top. yeah she got kicked out soon after too.

we got a daybed and ordered chips and salsa, the cocktail push-up pops, beer and other frozen blended drinks. no remnants of alcohol in those drinks whatsoever although i'm sure there was at most a shot in each of them. 

at around 5pm the pool started looking murky and it was totally warm. that's what you get when you have 200+ bodies in a pool. i think i'm going to stick with encore beach club.",3

went in for one ballon at 1:00.  told i would have to come back at 4:00.  they were to busy.  i was just getting the one ballon on my way to a party that started at 1:30. i just wanted to tie it on a bottle of champagne.   i asked for a manager- he still told me they were backed up with ballon orders . and that maybe if i wanted to wait around for 40 minutes he might be able to do it for me.   it took him longer to explain to me that i should have prearranged a order of one ballon then just to fill one up for me !  poor customer service coming from a store manager.,1
"i came in here after my lunch at omoide, because i needed to walk a little bit after lunch haha! i've been wanting to come to this place for some time now, and i'm so happy i finally made the visit here! i didn't catch the lady's name who helped me out, but she was very sweet and friendly also...great skin! i want to say thank you for your service. there's a huge selection of face masks, as well as creams. makeup selection was neatly displayed with moderate pricing. but there is definitely something here for everyone, the la girl cosmetics were very affordable yet highly pigmented btw!
worth a visit, they also have clothes, and hair accessories as well.
i'll definitely be back again!",5
"we made a reservation for a king bed.  when we arrived at 4 pm we were told all that was left was a room with twins or the handicapped room with a king.  we took the handicapped room which was next to laundry.  i am sitting in room at 12:45 am unable to sleep from the constant pounding, vibration, and random thumps of washers!!!  this morning i went down for breakfast 30 minutes before it ended and all that was left was cold cereal, scrapings of yogurt and 6 slices of bread.  because i was in a rush for an unexpected meeting they gave me a granola bar, chips and water. almost forgot all the loud talking of staff outside our door while they worked.  really tired at this point.  we travel a lot for business and this is one of the worst experiences i have had in a long time.  not ok to take advantage of people, especially handicapped.

ps  i sent an email to the hyatt and promptly received a response.  they refunded our two day charges and apologized. it turns out that breakfast had ended but the woman at the desk didn't know the times.  i suggested that in the future, that they warn folks about this room .",2
"my husband and i go here at least once a week.  it has just recently gone under new management and we couldn't be happier.  we have a one year old who gets kinda restless in restaurants and this place provides toys for them to play with.  the waitress we always have brings us crackers, fruit, pickles, etc. to help us calm our restless baby girl.

the food is amazing!  everything we have tried we love (except the cole slaw... it was too mayonaisse-y)  drink prices are awesome, i can't remember the exact prices, but cheaper than most bars\/pubs.",4
"oxtail. collard greens. yams. fried pork chops & red beans - cabbage, golden fried chicken, & sweet kool aid. need i say more? a valley original! 808 e. jefferson! downtown phx. you won't be disappointed by the hot juicy fresh gelatinousness!",5
"i ordered a graduation bouquet from here awhile back. chose this florist mainly for convenience as i live close by. however, on the day of when i went to pick it up, the florist completely forgot about my order. this would have made it a never visit again place. but the florist was able to quickly make a bouquet for me on the spot and it turned out amazing so i might give them a chance again in the future. about $55-70 for a dozen roses bouquet 

3 star for service
4 star for freshness
3.5 star for value",3
"i love this place. used to live around the corner and would bring the kids for dinner. i think it's the best pizza. but it has to do with lots of great memories with family and friends. i'd get the 22oz hef and the fat meat lovers pan pizza. the dough is great.  just chewy enough with a hint of sweetness.  the wings were great too. great times, great memories. this place is a winner in my book.",5
"april 26 was a rainy saturday morning. our daughter was in town, so 3 hungry adults headed out to have a nice breakfast. we arrived at 10:58 am, and after my husband parked the car we were at the register at 11:01 am. the restaurant was half empty.  we began to order and the cashier informed us the breakfast stopped at 11:00 am. i asked if we couldn't please still order. no, breakfast was served until 11:00!!! we said we'd go some place else.....no response!!!!! (very bad sign!). we went to chompies, where we were greeted by lovey borenstein, the owner, and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast!   and chompies has been in business for 35 years!

perhaps modern grove should get a clue!",2
"such hype.

came here to take a break after killing it at the tables @ caesars.  ordered a bit of everything.  nothing here is great or special.  just okay...  if you factor in the prices, it's a rip even by lv strip standards.

frozen hot choco would only be something special if you were living in a cave.  on mars.

service was horrible.  never saw the waitress again after our order was dropped off.  i left more than enough cash, and had to let another waitress know about it.

stupid thing is, i might just go to the one in nyc next month to compare!",2
"are you looking for a bargain? this is not your place.
are you looking for an amazing once in a lifetime vantage point? this could be your thing!

we visited on a recent trip to toronto and it was truly incredible. i am scared of heights but the view is so wonderful that i just ended up taking it all in and found it incredible! the elevator ride is fast enough that you can't even believe that you have ascended 131 floors already. 

i don't imagine that there would be any reason to visit cn tower more than once but it is definitely worth one trip! it is pricy for an attraction that doesn't last too long but i understand why they have to charge so much. they also offer a caa\/ aaa discount, just ask and show your card. 

*quick tip- it gets busy around 11am and the people can really impede your enjoyment (it gets full on the glass floor and you can't even get in there to take pictures or enjoy it). go early!",4
"nice market if you need groceries every now and then and live in the area. the produce section needs work, though. there's not enough there. ditto for fruits and fish. meats are ok, but i wish they had more grass-fed red meat. have heard rumors of price gouging because of the student body that surrounds the place, but i personally haven't observed it.",4
"walked in because i was passing by and i am glad i did.  one, it's popcorn! two, the salesperson (crystal) was very polite and friendly and helped me get everything i wanted, plus a few things i didn't even think to get...

"i agree with jake...mediocre at best....

boring layout and unkempt when busy....busy frequently!
finding a seating area off the main path is a plus!  the main path feels and looks like an over sized hallway...beware!  i have been to other cpk's and this one is layed out poorly compared to others i've been to (san luis obispo in california, san francisco in the business district, and one in scottsdale close to bell and scottsdale blvd.---very nice!)

at this particular location, service was a disaster this past wednesday evening after work 02-13-08.  ----the two dishes ordered were: tomato basil spaghettini with goat's cheese, and the second dish was fettuccine with garlic cream sauce with chicken.

both dishes came out at the same time---the tomato basil spaghettini was warmish, at best...the garlic with cream sauce with chicken had no chicken! ---(had to be returned to the kitchen) .  i asked the waiter to please return mine to a hot oven or lamp so that i could begin at the same time as my guest...  all this time the waiter acted as if he were doing us a favor, as if we were disturbing him from sorting his receipts from his other poorly served customers!

when the food finally arrived, my dish was even colder, just mildly warm!#!$#!  

i recommend that if you are out to impress a guest in any capacity, this is not that place to take them...go next door to the cheesecake factory!  i'm not sure about the service, but the whole layout at least,  looks inviting and clean.",2
great place to get connected to well managed volunteer opportunities. i highly recommend them.,5
"my friend and i had been waiting for a table for 20 minutes.  i notice that she sat 2 couples before my friend and i.  i went up and said, ""we have been waiting and you say people who came after us!""  her response, i sorry we skipped over your name!""  ridiculous... you only have one job - to take names and seat them accordingly.   i was led to an i cleaned table and had to wait for the server to clean it off.  then, the spoon sets my friend and i received had food stuck to it...yuck!!! so i desired to get plastic ware. i ordered a farmers breakfast with grits. while i was about to shake some salt on my grits and notice something black inside the shaker.  it was a long strand of hair!! how did it get there?!?!?!? and so, i used the salt packets that came with my plasticware.  my grits were cooked well and tasted great, and fresh made butter really increased the flavor.  

the wait for my breakfast was very long but my food was warm!!  my meal over all was decent, however, the experience started off rough!!!",2
staff is definitely a lot friendly that any of the other starbucks. surprised most of the staff remembers me after 3 months.,5
"new owner just had the grand opening. super nice guy and the staff is awesome. 

very cozy and clean.

we had an awesome lunch today. i had the turkey revelation which was really yummy with a tangy sauce.  my wife had a veggie wrap. we shared some tabouli which was out of this world. then we took home a tif's pizza which was this super thin crust zesty dish which we saved for dinner. 

we love the place and will be back.",5
"came to visit my family out here in az, we stopped by to eat since my parents have never tried lebanese. i ordered they lamb\/beef gyro with fries, and spicy cayenne hummus. the flavors were delicious. the gyro wasn't over drenched in the yogurt sauce, it was just right. the fries were nice & crispy. the hummus, man that is fire! must try!!! my only issue with this place is my wife ordered an extra garlic spread,and they charged another $1.50 for this. i've at several lebanese restaurants, they never charge. but, i'd suggest this place to anyone if your in the city of avondale.",4
"i loved using this place when i lived in vegas! they have repaired countless pairs of leather thigh hi gogo boots for me, replaced the soles of some of the said gogo boots, and repaired the rubber parts on numerous pairs of heels. i've also had a long flowy skirt hemmed and most recently i bought a pair of those 'gladiator' style heels that don't fit normal calves... they altered those to fit my legs as well. this small family owned business was a life saver!",5
mark did an amazing job. communication was great and the price was the best that i had found. he completed the service as discussed with absolutely no issues. i highly recommend mark and will definitely use him again in the future. thank you mark!!!!,5
"the food here deserves 5 stars but i'm giving it 3 because of the staff.
i've been coming here for quite some time now and everyone that comes to vegas to visit me, i bring them here and highly recommend this place to all my friends. but recently when i come in the staff is so incredibly rude it's starting to make me hate it here. 
last time i came i brought 7 people with me and was basically told by the door girl that my party was too big and they could ""see if they could seat us"" and that the wait would be over an hour. i gladly gave them my number and told them we would be at sushi way (next door) having a drink while waiting. after about an hour and a half we went to check and they claimed they called me (but they didn't) and made us wait even longer then put to tables together and stuffed us in. then when the table next to us opened up we asked if we could add the empty table so we weren't elbow to elbow and they were so incredibly rude about it, it made all of us uncomfortable after asking that. 

my friend (who i highly recommended this place to) came in on his lunch break and sat at the bar. he told me he actually timed it and sat for 21 minutes before the bar tender even acknowledged him. by this time his break was almost over so he got up and left. and said there were only 4 other people sitting at the bar. 

i use to come here and be personally greeted by the manager, matter of fact i have about 3 of his business cards. that's how great the service use to be here. now they're rude and completely disrespectful.

hopefully you guys get it together and hire more friendly staff. i'll give it a few gos before i stop bringing people here.",3

"ich bin ja sehr erstaunt, dass diese super-nette weinstube mit wohnzimmercharakter noch keine bewertung hat. wir waren im rahmen einer tagung dort und es war sehr sehr schön dort. essen, getränke und besonders das gastwirtsehepaar war sehr aufmerksam und freundlich! es gab überhaupt nichts auszusetzen und man fühlte sich sofort wie zu hause (in der guten stube nämlich). sehr empfehlenswert!",5
"a month ago, i made a trip to ny to see my cousins and happened to be at strawberry fields memorial at central park where john lennon's ashes sprinkled around... it was a great moment to be there and see all the love offerings such as, roses, candles, and art works on the ground,, the word ""imagine"" was still on the mosaic...


so, four of us watched the beatle show @5:30 on one sunday evening. i had no idea about the show and i didn't want to read the reviews before watching.  i like surprises and i was sure that i would like the show no matter what.. the universal appeal of the beatles all ages and races love them anyways :-). 
the performers on the stage were all fantastic!  all i can say is that they're so talented.  all the way to the end of the show, they were singing live one song after another, amazing!!
if you truly love the beatles' music, it is a great show to watch.  during the show, you will get to sing along and dance to your favorite songs.
i still remember the scene of john lennon was playing a white grand piano and singing ""imagine"" wearing a white tux.   i don't know why but i almost burst in tears.
the costume and the lighting effect were great also.  
you will get a chance to order your drink while watching the show but there is a bar at the saxe theater before you entering the show.   if you get there a little early enough, you can take some time to grab a favorite drink of yours. 
*i really enjoyed the show!  thank you, lily d :)*",4
all of the staff were extremely nice and they were patient and professional. the pizza was absolutely outstanding. i did what was called the high top and added extra arugula to it and caramelized onions. everybody else enjoyed their pizzas just as much and i would come back here in a moment. i actually think that we will open one of these restaurants are self next week,5
mere is the sh**. great service for our crazy group of girls! super busy and fun environment :),5

"definitely, my new favorite ramen restaurant in las vegas. very clean place and excellent service too.",5
"it is rare to give a restaurant 2 stars when they prompt you to literally throw up. but that is a testament to the pasties being quite good. my partner, who visited the restaurant with me, commented that one chef appeared to ""hate his life"" as he moved his hands between food preparation and a sweaty brow. as a result, my partner opted against ordering meat (which he said looked rancid). at the time i thought this was melodramatic. i was wrong.

i ordered the peppered steak pasty, which i devoured hungrily. over the next 5 hours i became gradually nauseous. let's just say (5 hours later) the food was less tasty on the way back up. at least with food poisoning, the symptoms end abruptly with the elimination of the rancid food. i was back out on the strip two hours later (i.e. 7-9 hours after eating said pasties), but opted to drink instead of eat my dinner.

[updated 7\/31\/15: thanks to the business owner for the facts from the cdc. it seems they reaffirm the likely explanation of food poisoning. but in all fairness, i bet this was a freak occurrence, and the food was great. and who knows, perhaps it was actually the southwest airlines honey-roasted peanuts i had eaten 15 hours earlier.]",2
"dr. evans saved both of my pets lives- my dog after having his throat literally ripped open by another dog and my cat after he stopped eating and developed fatty liver disease as a result.

it is currently 12:35am and i am staying at the motel 6 next door. i walked over to mcdonald's. the door says they close at 1:00am. the door is locked. i knock on the door. a tall black guy looks out from the counter and does the it's over sign to me. i hold up 1 finger and then point to the door because it says closed at 1am. the black guy who i am assuming is the manager just shrugs his shoulders. now him and another employee start laughing. owner needs to do something about their employees fast losing money and business everyday i'm sure.,1
"once again!  this place never lets me down, i tried their tomatoe soup and a croissant tuna salad sandwich along with it! absolutely tasty. i would definitely recommend anyone try this mix out. thank you very much to the all the hard working staff at this establishment. my lunch was very delicious! !",5
"i love this place i go in once a week n the steak  burritos are amazing.the hot head sauce is so flavorful. the service has always been good , the food is fresh and the restaurant is clean and sanitary.  maybe they have some inconsistency issues but it's a new business and i welcome them into the neighborhood.",5
"tldr; great guide (josh), fair price, desert trail riding experience. book it with confidence.

the deets; i did the morning mtb ride in red rock canyon on the cottonwood trail system. i called for a few details before reserving online which was super easy. josh picked me up in the van (a couple minutes late, but no problem, he had to pick up someone before me). josh was not only our driver, but our guide as well. he had the bikes loaded on racks in on the back of the van a box of snacks and a cooler filled with a case of bottled water(we drank them all, he said the cooler's usually still half full after the ride). another gentleman was on the tour with me and we were about the same pace so it worked well(group trips like this almost completely depend on the group that you're paired with). the drive is about 30 minutes from the las vegas strip and we started from the late night trail head. from there we hit a 7.5 mile loop that we did in about an hour. the trails were mustang to lil' pony to white rhino to late night fast mile. it was fun, mostly slight grades with one really fun down hill segment (white rhino). the only negative is they use terrible hydration packs that don't seal (one of the guys bladders leaked, and the other's spilled so just used bottles), luckily i brought my own. bike blast seriously needs to invest in camelbacks.",5
"we went to level 107 lounge last night due to the overwhelming amazing yelp reviews.  we were not disappointed, but we were not over the top impressed either.  it is true, the martini specials are 2 for 1, but don't bother looking at the regular menu.  they have a special list that they present you with and the list looks like a toothache.  if you are looking to get your daily fruit intake then this is the place.  the list included, apple, pomegranate, mango, and every other fruit under the rainbow as well as the traditional martini, cosmopolitan and the manhattan.  after ordering the manhattan we were told that the manhattan is no longer apart of the 2 for 1 list.  anyways, we  enjoyed the chicken wings, had about 12 martinis and enjoyed the view.  the service was decent and for the price we paid it was worth it!! just be prepared for the limited martini menu.",3
"i know it's terrible for you, but i think i have an addiction to carbonation.  this place is a dream come true.  i don't think i'll ever be brave enough to try all the different types of soda available, but i'm glad the option is there.
the novelty candy is another plus.  on impulse we bought a bag of warheads.  it was a mistake we had to make.  i'm pretty sure we didn't have any taste buds as kids because those candies are absolutely terrible lol.
but it's a good time.  a nice little trip in there before a movie at village square could be a perfect date.",5
we called another company to come out last month and the bugs came right back. we called about the guarantee but it seems they are no longer in business. my boyfriends neighbor recommended az exterminating and so we tried it. that we're very nice and professional. the guy even gave us some tips help us keep the crickets away. i too would recommend arizona exterminating to my friends and family. the service was great and i think they will be around to honor guarantee.,5
"i was driving back from tempe the other day, and on my way back home i was in desperate need for a car wash.

a couple weeks back, i purchased an unlimited wash package at the carwasher near my home in old town, but i was desperate. there was dust everywhere...and i can't have that.

i pulled into quick n' clean, and got a premium wash for $10 even though i could've paid $3 for a quick rinse. i believe in taking care my car. some day it's a waste of money....but i don't need to listen to ""some"". i'm my own boss :)

the wash was fantastic. literally, quick....and....clean. 

the best part is after you are done, you can use their vacuums for free. my car has been perfect since i detailed it myself, but it's nice to know that i have a go-to spot for free vacuums.

i wish they offered an unlimited car wash special for the monsoon season. i'd definitely bring my business here, even if it is a little further away.",4
"yes, so it's fast food with a mediterranean twist, but at the end of the day it's still fast food.

it does all the usual greasy finger food staple, like burgers and pizza, but they also do some tasty greek-inspired dishes as well. personally, i love anything with cheese, sun-blushed tomato, aubergine or avocado in it, but i can't help but thinking this is just yet another fast food place in a part of the city where there are already way too many.

it's not open late at night, so it's not ideal for your munchies when it's chucking-out time in the pubs, but if you're after a greasy grab-and-go lunch then you might want to give it a try.",3
"this is such a great spot for a delicious italian meal and crisp cocktail! our server, trevor, was super knowledgable about the menu and gave us outstanding suggestions! the cappers trio is a great way to start! we went with the pappardelle, the maltagliati, and the verdure with salmon. everything was delicious and this pasta is outstanding! definitely check this place out. we can't wait to go back.",5
oh my god this is one of the most dirtiest cvs as i've ever been to. i think whoever the manager there and needs to start yelling at the employees and get them to clean this place up. the service is very slow. the pharmacy is not bad. not one of my favorite cbs is i'll tell you that right now.,2
"this place is definitely a go-to if you want a good waffle. all of the waffles are delicious. they also have omelettes and some other breakfast items, as well as a lunch menu. i had and omelette once too, and it was okay, but wasn't anything to rave about like the waffles.one thing that is cool is that they have a bunch of different syrups. they have your normal maple syrup, but they also have a whiskey syrup which isn't as sweet, as well as some other options. 

just a warning, if you go on a weekend, be prepared to wait 30 minutes to an hour.they offer to call you when your table is ready, so if you really wanted to you could go walk around southside works as long as you don't venture too far away.

for as nice as a place it is i didn't expect such as ""get them in get them out attitude"". i know they get busy, but since it's a little higher end than a diner i kind of expected a little more attentiveness from the staff...but it's okay, because the waffles are so good!",4
i love this place so much that i'm kind of embarrassed of how much i go and i order the samething everytime. if you haven't tried the shrimp tempura udon...you are definitely missing out. i am addicted.,5
excellent food and service...must try! under new management & new menu coming soon! had the pizza and it was excellent....it was the best pizza i ever had! we will be back.,5
"discovered this place with my friend recently and we both fell in love with it. i even went back by myself for lunch a few times. i reccomend sitting at the bar, the set up is really interesting and although there's alot of people working in such a small restaurant it feels like an intimate family oriented restaurant it's really nice. get the chefs to choose a mix of oysters for you... the only ones i wasn't fond of is the west coast ones, their huge and the shells are really bumpy so it should uncomfortable eating them plus they don't taste as good in my opinion. also it's a great place but it's really pricey so just a heads up but it is worth it.",5
"i love options. i'm the kind of person that when i have chicken strips, i want 4 different dipping sauces.

this place fulfills my need for options in a way that their competitors can't.

the menu is a little confusing, and the daily specials board doesn't have prices or explain that it includes a drink.

i had the special, the chicken tostada salad, a tostada with rice and beans, piled with romaine, chicken, pico de gallo, a dollop of sour cream, tortilla strips, and some dressing that tasted exactly like the jalapeno ranch i covered everything with at chuy's when i lived in texas. 

i also ordered chips and queso, which came with a pretty good salsa and more pico.

drinks! vanilla coke! horchata! tea and lemonade! (see what i mean about options?)

everything is served in foil ""to-go"" containers, with lids on the condiment bar for easy transport.

next time i go i think i'll try one of the tortillas they seem so proud of. 

oh, and visit their website and click ""i don't care"" down toward the bottom. you'll thank me.",3
this place is perfect.  very relaxing and a great atmosphere    lemon mint hookah.  mint tea. winning all around.   great service.  very nice staff.  if you are looking for a nice clean place in montreal this is the place to go,5
tina was my ideal server (friendly and attentive but not overbearing). the place is clean. the weekend special philly burger with ghost pepper jack cheese was spectacular. my girlfriend (extremely picky) ordered the bacon bleu burger and loved it. my only complaint was a 20 min wait (packed house). bravo rehab burger!,5
pretty good.  chicken came out cold but they rectified it by warming it up.  good selection of drinks.  nice spacious patio.,3
"i have a stamped card buy 10 get 1 free. i have 7 stamps in the card, 3 more i'll get a free one.  we have 4 people, but they don't let me pay for 3 and have the 4th person for free.  also the manage there is not nice at all.",1
"great food!! fast, friendly and fun service. nice and clean inside, worried when we pulled up and there was only a few cars in the parking lot, but very happy we didn't leave. we will be back!",5
"this place is hit & miss every time we go there, don't go there and expect good service you will most likely get ok service at best...the food selection is great as long as they don't burn it, we are a family of three and sure enough every time we have gone there one of us has gotten our food burned by the cooks, then it's a real pain in the arse to get your food re-done and by then the rest of the family is done and waiting..bottom line, usually bad service along with 1 out of 3 meals being burt..=1 star..i will say this if you ignore the waitress and they don't burn your food it's a pretty good meal..",1
"great service and delicious dishes, including the magic mushrooms; the fusilli was scrumptious, but i had some dinner envy going on after observing my friend's black angus steak plate. was also introduced to a tasty vodka aranciata (vodka and orange san pellegrino), which made everything go down - and time pass - very easily.",4
"not sure why haven't done a review on this place. my wife and i have been ordering and picking up from here for about a year now. so often she is getting tired of burritos. but not me!!! i love this place. just pick something, anything!! it's all good. my favorite is the special burrito for breakfast. we have ordered it probably twice a month for the last year. we get it with rice and beans on the side and they are both delicious as well. i love their red salsa too. compliments the special burrito so well. just go here you won't regret it!",5
"i went here about a few days ago and ordered the banana fosters french toast (highly not recommended). after it was give to me it was doused and drenched in syrup (not caramel). for an example of caramel, i asked for a side of caramel, the texture and color difference was absolutely visible. do not waste your time, money, or patience here, the cooks and servers certainly don't.


as a side note, i frequent this place, but after observing how they handle and how long they let their food ferment, it will be the last, this goes for their world famous bakery. most of it sits for weeks.",1
"i'm prepared for yelpers to come to my house with pitchforks and giant logs threatening to tear down my door and have my head, but i'll admit that i was not blown away.

i have been aching to try the nutella latte forevs, and when i did today, it seemed like just a regular latte. not hazelnutty, not chocolatey, just a latte. meh. i wanted something so rich and thick that i couldn't guzzle it down, but i guzzled it like i could any other latte, and it was $4.50. eep! i wanted to get the delicious looking fruit salad, too, but it was $7.75. double eep! not a budget-friendly coffee shop.

the croissant was, i'll admit, a fairly good imitation of european croissants. however, it, too, was pricey, and not as delicious as i felt it could have been. i love macarons, and i do mean love, but they were also pretty meh. i want a combination of crispy and chewy in my macarons, not just chewy. 

it gets major brownie points for the outlets, decor, and cool location. it's on the other side of the world for me, so i'm not sure i'd make a special trip. i'd be willing to give its sandwiches a try, and just stick with regular espresso.",3
"this is not an exaggeration

the med caf is my single, all-time favorite restaurant in all the world.

i ate here bi-weekly for four years in college and recently visited madison again only to find that the med caf is better than ever.

the place is still run by a committed, warm staff that acts like a huge family.  they are still serving huge portions of authentic food at a bargain.  they are still located in the cutest, coziest hole-in-the wall building right on state street.

here's what you do: 
-bring cash

-if there is a line, ignore it, it will move quickly

-snag a tiny table and commence the fascinating people-watching (or get it to go and take it to library mall)

-order a tea.  it's super dark and sweetened.  it will heat you from the inside and transport you to a far-off country.  instant feeling of comfort ensues

-check out the daily specials, they rotate each day of the week.  

-if you see chicken apricot pie on the menu (thursday's special), order me a plate!  this is perhaps the best food i've ever tasted.  i plan my weeks around it 

-if no daily specials appeal to you, order a hummus plate with chicken. the chicken is tender and juicy without weird chunks of cartilage or bone. it's topped with a creamy mystery heaven sauce. it comes with a salad so you feel you're are doing your body a favor.

-try to save a tiny bit of room for dessert. all you need is one small piece of baklava. flaky and not overly sweet. the perfect end to the best meal of your life


seriously, this place is life-changing. i owe a great deal of my college loans to this place but i have no regrets!",5
"it simply can't get any better than this company. mike, the owner, answered my call immediately, was at my house within a half hour, diagnosed the problem and fixed it at the most reasonable price i could have imagined for the service provided. it was one hour from the time i called to the time he left my house with a fully functioning garage door. he explained exactly what was going on with the garage door, what the options were and suggested the least expensive path all with friendly attitude. do yourself a favor and call mike if you want fast, excellent, cost-effective service.",5
"i have had good experiences at luna, but today was just ok.  four of us went for brunch and even though we had a reservation, it took a while to get seated. the service was a bit slow, but it was pretty busy.

the pear beignets were yummy and the coffee was good. the entrees were a little disappointing especially since i've had a good brunch here before. we ordered the croque monsieur and swiss roesti.  both come with a fried egg on top, but the egg yolks were hard and not runny at all - maybe because our food sat under the heat lamp or broiler for too long. 

i will go back because i want to give luna another change to make my brunchy dreams come true.",3
"let me start with the positive: it's overall very clean, foods not bad and has the cutest bathroom i've ever seen. 
now let me dive into my experience last night ... i bought a living social for 2 flights of wine and an appetizer. i was looking forward to using it for months and was extremely disappointed. the waiter, let's call him hipster with (most likely) non prescription hipster glasses. least attentive server i've ever met. it would've been fine if he was hustling around. but he bopped around. there were maybe 10 other people with little demands. (i bartend and used to serve. it's obvious when someone's at least trying). we'd order a sample and 10 minutes later we'd see him again with our wine. 15 minutes later he'd come back and take our order again. over an hour went by and we were only 4 samples in, had finished our appetizer, wanted to order a full glass of wine and were extremely annoyed. we finally went to the bar, asked for our last sample and a full glass of wine and the bill all at once. hipster was of course bopping around, not attending tables and still did not have these samples that magically took 20 minutes to pour and deliver. 
the only thing that saved our night was the nice man who made us a strawberry dessert on the house without us asking. thank you sir! i would've given this a 2 star if it weren't for you. 
ps the games were a blast, but there was a dead cockroach and no game pieces in one of the boxes. 
pps thank god for the music from the art walk. there was no atmosphere (besides some chatter). just crickets. most likely from inside one of the games.
this place has potential. please hire someone with experience and who doesn't bop around in la la land.",3
"this is honestly the rudest service i have ever gotten. i was close to walking out if it wasn't for my friend holding me back. we were seated by someone who said absolutely nothing but ""fallow."" and then set down the menus and left. she said nothing else, nothing about my waiter, nothing! then the waitress was the women who worked as the bartender, she wasn't fast but her job isn't to be a waitress... 

we ordered the calamari and the guy comes up to my table and sets the calamari at the edge of the table and left. i blurted out ""wow, really?"" he comes back and then replies ""oh, i'm sorry did you want me to take this back?"" i told him he was rude and he looks at me and smiles... walks away and under his breath says ""christ. fucking people."" 

i'm absolutely appalled...",1
"decent seafood at a good price. cheap drinks, kid friendly, an east choice - a fave!",4
"so i finally experienced the move out process..not good. this is the first place i have rented from that requires you to leave the property move in ready..as if moving isnt stressful enough..you have to paint everything, deap clean, landscape, and clean carpets. i had a 1200.00 deposit, i paid 300.00 to have someone professionally clean and 100.00 for carpet cleaning. when i got my move out ledger it stated i was in the negative and still owed an additional 400.00! they were still charging me an additional 200.00 for cleaning and 100.00 again for carpet cleaning..i was hot and contacted lorraine..she did the right thing and credited my fees for those 2 charges which made me break even..my place was clean and painted but apparently it wasnt up to their standards and over charged me for repainting, ect..so if you rent from costello dont ever expect to get your deposit back, not even a partial return. i did gain an amazing realtor, through costello, j. chamsi that i did use when i rented then bought my home, he is great.",3
"not only was today my first taste of little india buffet restaurant, but also of indian food altogether.
i would be lying if i said i was not having my doubts and felt out of my element just thinking about the fact i would venture into new food territory, but my good friend nudged me towards the ""oh-so famous"" butter chicken and i thought to myself, ""why not try new things?!""

thank goodness i did, this place was amazing!

such a cute little place in amidst the chaos of toronto's core, well decorated and scented with incense from far away land...it was like an overload of taste and smell i had never experienced in my life. i imagined myself in india....and then the plate was empty and i got up for some more...

the bottom line- this place is great even for begginers like me (they label everything) and why not try something new? lunch was only $11.99!
i must also add- the service was impeccable! i don't remember the last time a waiter treated every customer with kindness and courtesy. it was like they liked their job....i must really mention this : the service was exceptional!

if you are already an indian food fan...head over to this place, there's a reason why they get the best reviews!
i will be back!",4
"i wish they still had the buffalo steak.  had it the first time i came, then the past two times it's not been on the menu.  bring it back!  other than that - this place is nice. great decor, friendly waitstaff, and amazing food.  try the hen of the woods mushrooms along with your steak - they're probably the best thing on the menu (and that's not to put down the steaks at all)",3
"ordered take out first, dined-in next with friends and then we were impressed enough to have our little guy's second bday here. the chicken vindaloo, the mango lassi shots , samosas, kulfi were standouts but everything we got was better than your ordinary fare indian experience. raj, thank you for looking after us and our guests :) we will see you more often for sure",5
"first of all, the price can't be matched.  i had another company quote almost twice as much for the same work to be done, and that was including them giving me a discount.  ahw was definitely the right price.

i made my appointment and right on time, gerardo showed up, went over the process, and got right to work.  he was considerate of my sleeping baby, and did his best to stay completely quiet.  he even gave me a heads up when he was about to start drilling the granite counter top for my new r\/o spout.

the unit installed on the first day actually had a problem with it, so gerardo came back out and got it repaired\/replaced right away.  i highly recommend this company, and want to give special kudos to gerardo for his great service!

"awesome.  get military discounts every day.  we had both of our boys' birthday parties there this year and both were great.   they are very accommodating to our special dietary needs and offered us a great discount since we weren't going to have their pizza for our party and let us bring in our own food instead.  very food allergy friendly in that way, which is awesome. the kids love it and enjoy going every time. a nice indoor place to go when it gets too hot outside!",5

"woke up today and got into my ride and started that bad boy and boom! the screen reads ""needs oil change"". looked around at different places and came across this establishment. cris took care of all my vehicle needs and the customer service is by far the best i've seen. i'll definitely be coming back for my 15,000 mile check up and so forth. 

so if you're looking for a great place for an oil change with awesome customer service then this place is for you. thanks again cris!",5
"great concept in urbana-- kids loved it.  they provide shoes, and you don't need harnesses like other rock climbing places.  great way to kill a couple of hours when it's cold outside!",4
"we decided to try avenue b to celebrate a fellow yelpers birthday.  we're both lovers of anything byob, so avenue b was a front runner from the beginning.  it's a cute little space tucked right on the corner of centre.  parking was a little tricky, but we expected that.  the exposed brick and chalkboards set the right tone for me.

we started with the gorgonzola flat bread and calamari.  both were very good.  if i had to pick one over the other i'd go with the flat bread again.

after reading all the rave reviews about the fish and chips, my decision was made before i walked in the door.   i chose the pan seared option on the fish and it was cooked perfectly.  the chips and the slaw that accompanied the dish met my expectations.  i'll definitely be back again.  the rest of the table ordered from the chalk board menu.  we had the tofu, veal medallions, and hanger steak.  we shared a side of brussels sprouts.  i'm not typically a fan of brussels sprouts, but avenue b won me over.  everyone really enjoyed their dinners!

looking forward to b gourmet opening in sewickley soon!",4
"this is our first visit and we'll definitely be back. i had the stewed chicken meal and it was great! hubby had the short rib meal and the short ribs were you die for!!  that's on my list for our next visit. the potato salad was different but awesome.  made with egg and corn. yum! when you're done with dinner,  don't forget the bread pudding! had a smooth texture, not like the lumpy stuff you're used to. i prefer it this way so much more!",5
"i'm basing this off my love of pineapple buns. 

meaning...i've never had anything else from there store other then their pineapple buns.

their plain pineapple buns are $0.60 
their filled pineapple buns buns ....either custard, red bean, or coconut filled ...is $0.80 

really, what can you buy in a downtown bakery for 60-80 cents?   really no much...at least none that i can think of.   most singular bun items were all priced at the $0.80 mark.  

their pineapple buns are baked throughout the day, usually only a couple hours old, and sometimes you can get them still warm out of the oven.   my favourite is the coconut filled one....tastes like a  coconut milk bun filling.  yummy!     they are large...bigger then the size of my palm ...and eats like a breakfast (or lunch).   

i generally come in to just buy a bun if i walk by and have enough change in my pocket.  

this is the closest chinese bakery within walking distance to me....and i'm really glad it's around.   

so yeah...when in doubt or hungry, get a pineapple bun from here.",4
"stopped in for lunch on 2nd day being open.  ordered 2 burgers and a club sandwich.  multiple patrons came in and ordered after our order was placed.  everyone received their food prior to ours. a gentleman who we later were told was the owner was dropping off food to the table next to ours.  we asked where our food was - he seemed to be bothered by this and responded that it's cooking.  he then asked what we ordered.  10 minutes prior to this our waitress said they were plating our food.  looks like there are some kinks to be worked out.

our food came out in approx 45 minutes.  the burgers were both ordered as medium - 1 came out medium well and the other came out rare.  when ordering tots - be ware that only 3 come with it.  they were really good though.  side of fries were ordered with the other 2 orders - they both came with chips only. the waitress apologized and brought out one order of fries and then approx 10 minutes later another order of fries.

the owner never came back to apologize or check in on the orders.  given this is a new business it is expected that there will be some early glitches.  it's all about how the issues are handled.",2
"ugh ... maybe i'm just getting really old, but this place was too crowded, too noisy, too slow to serve the drinks and the drinks were just nasty.  next!",2

"this is a must go to if you are in charlotte, nc.  i was taken here for a business dinner and we ordered ""everything on the menu"" literally.  it was so awesome i had to make a stop when i came back into town.  this time we just sat at the bar, a much smaller group, and we each ordered 2 items to share and a flat bread.  it was plenty of food.  i also love the beer selection and the bartender was really awesome!  i will keep going back. :)",4

"went there last sunday after a quick check out on yelp for a cooked breakfast with my friend jon. we wanted some egg and bacon but fancied escaping the south and west of edinburgh, where we both stay.

the place is neat and the location is really nice, just a short stroll away from the royal botanic gardens and new town. if it hadn't been for the pesky rain we would have probably enjoyed a nearby park after eating.

big teapot with enough milk to my liking. breakfast ingredients looked fresh and seemed of a good quality. the only downer was that i'm not a huge fan of scottish breakfast containing haggis and black pudding (giblets in general), i much prefer the more english variant with mushrooms or tomatoes. still filling though.

free wifi, and you can pay by card.",4
"this place sucks. the parking takes forever to find, buffet is overpriced and takes 3 hours to pay, direction is confusing! will never come back.",1
"not impressed with this location at all. for starters, they couldn't figure out how to honor a current coupon that was sent out in a mailer. since it was the only reason i had called, that was discouraging. i ordered a pizza anyway and, a full hour later, it still had not arrived.

 i called back to see what was going on and was told it was an issue with online orders. good explanation - except i didn't order online and they didn't bother explaining how that had any effect on the current location of my dinner. roughly ten minutes after i got off the phone, the pizza showed up - luke warm, full price, and disappointing. 

at least one of those three terms can generally be applied to papa johns but all three at once is pretty unusual. thankfully there is no shortage of mediocre pizza chains in the area.",1
"based purely on the couple cocktails i've tried and couple of their small bites ... i will be back.  i have been back... a few times! wow ... the james woods is my fave drink here.  its just so tasty.  and the pretzels... my friends rave about those pretzels! there's usually a good crowd here, without being too many people... music is good, bartenders know what they're doing.  price is moderate, but comparable to any decent bar making a quality cocktail.  there are tvs, and there's a dart board if you're into keeping your hands busy while drinking.  ;-)",4
"from the time we got there to when we left, we had a great experience.  our server was amazing and was right there with drinks and napkins before we had to ask. the menu has a nice selection of food items and there are specials as well. last night's special was a burger and fries for $5.99. i had a full rack of ribs for $20 and they were meaty and the sauce was great. my husband had shrimp. they were large and tasted very good. we substituted fries with poor man wings which are steak fries basted in sweet parmesian (our favorite) or other flavors.. they are wonderful! for dessert we had brownie bites with ice cream and whipped cream.  perfect way to end a meal.",4
i used this service about 6 weeks ago. i stumbled across there ad in super pages while looking for alternatives to boarding our dogs for about a week. these guys are great! i was reassured the whole time our dogs were being well cared for while we were gone. if you someone to look after your animals and they not leave your home this is the way to go ! i will be using them again.,5
"decided to give this place a try this weekend. so glad we did! i'm a big sushi fan, and i really enjoyed the revolving conveyor style service. we got to try some great new rolls and the staff was very attentive. they were constantly putting out new rolls, so nothing stayed out too long. we'll definitely be going back!",5
"we are very pleased with the job, we had 2 bathrooms done, next project master bathroom and i highly recommend them.",5
"i should predicate this review with a little background.  i've visited this p.f. changs probably 6 times over the past three years.  it's usually because there are enough people at work who want to go that we all go.  i found something on the menu that i liked and i stuck with it.  prior visits were unspectacular, but once i found ""dan dan noodles"" i was set.

at least i was until the visit before my most recent visit.  they were bland in an ironic sort of extremely salty way.  do you know what i mean?  i mean, it's hard to say that something that tastes like it just came out of a salt shaker is bland, but if that's the only taste it has, then that's what my last order of dan dan noodles tasted like.

this time, i resolved to find something new to replace dan dan noodles (can you tell i like saying dan dan noodles?  because i do) for future visits.  meh.  i'm done with pf changs, at least lunch and dinner (because i still have a free happy hour dim sum for checking in on yelp!).  

i ordered the kung pao chicken and found the kung lacking and also no pao.  what they did not leave out, however, was the salt.  holy crap!  the waitress (good waitress) gave me a replacement mr. pibb, suggesting i'd need it to finish my kung pao (presumably because it would be so spicy)...and i did need it.  but just to wash down the salt.

it was like i ordered a salt lick with a side of ...i'm not sure what...some sort of cold vinegar preparation of sliced vegetables.  i was stuck as to whether they were pairing pseudo-kim che with my faux chinese food.  regardless it was not awesome.  i'm not kidding when i say the most enjoyable part of the meal was the fried rice, which is not to say that the fried rice was good...it just wasn't as awful as everything else.

people like this place, and i don't want my review to sway them away, but it was not good.  the atmosphere is great, the wait staff was quick and efficient...but the food is expensive and not good.",2
"had a party here on saturday august 5th, purchased a cake from here and it had mold spots everywhere. didn't realize the cake had mold since they provide a host to cut and serve the cake. sadly about 10 of our guests are the cake before we noticed. at first they said it was sprinkles dissolving from the bottom, but the mold was in the middle of the cake. they admitted it was mold and that they had 7 cakes in the back dated the same day as the one we purchased. they said they would check them. took a couple of pictures. i'm still waiting for a call from corporate. also have had some of our guests get sick.",1
loved how they explained everything and i l me the atmosphere. very clean. also enjoy the fact you get it's open 24 hours and totally inexpensive,5
"i'm shocked that this place doesn't have more 5 star reviews!  they really go so above and beyond!  the food is exceptional with tons of delicious choices on the menu, and the service is so warm and friendly.  a very nice italian family that knows what they're doing:)  also, this place is in no way overpriced!  i always feel like they are losing money off of me!",5
"i live more than 25 miles away, but i choose to go to ahs every time because the staff and facility are both fantastic. my dog rushes to the door whenever we pull in, and i know it's not just because he's fed treats around the clock. this is even after he's gone in for an injury involving stitches, iv, catheter, and an e-collar for more than 5 days straight. that tells me a lot about the kind of care he receives here. dr. prevatt, patti, and rob are great, as well as all the technicians. i call to check on my dog whenever i'm out of town,  and i always get a detailed update on my dog from any one of them. very fortunate to have a place like this around. open 24 hours for affordable service - but it's the people in scrubs that really sets this place apart from the rest. highly recommended.",5
"rebecca is wonderful and it is no wonder why she has a 5 star rating!  she is very kind and makes the facial an experience to remember.  i went for the 1 hour facial. she guided me through a  peel, a mask, a hand and arm massage, etc.  we had a pleasant conversation as well!  if you want a relaxing facial and glow, rebecca is the perfect choice!",5
"forced to go to this place for an annual check up due to my insurance. i didn't check the reviews first which i guess was my first mistake. for the record, i went to the baseline location which is not located in yelp. i went to this office twice. the first time was a check up and the second was because the doctor who saw me left the practice and their policy is that you must see a current doctor in order to have an active prescription from them. so in other words, just because you get a prescription from them, you may need to go back to them within a year's period if that doctor leaves. and apparently their retention is not great. they ended up charging me $80 just to have a prescription with a zero refill added back in. i confirmed with three other doctors in the area and a typical prescription of this type should be good for 1 year before an actual new visit is needed. this clinic\/practice is more interested in getting a little more money than the care of their patients. i get health care isn't great nowadays, but if you get a choice, read the reviews and try to avoid this place.",1
if you use this place make sure you keep every copy of your receipt or they will try to give you the runaround. the manager mike is very unprofessional.,1
"i came to snapdragon for a color correction.  snapdragon not only fixed my hair from the last place but made it look natural and amazing!!! the whole snapdragon team was nice, educated, professional and helpful. my correction was not easy. i came in with bright yellow and orange hair, with a bunch of gross toner and who knows what else from the previous place. kandy  (my hair colorist) was a hair genius and confident! she did a great job. i can't thank her enough!!!  i was desperate and got 1000x what i expected. the bonus was that i expected to pay a lot more than i did for that level of expert. i'm never going anywhere else...ever.  i recommend this place to anyone. ps they are busy and can book out quite a bit in advance. make sure to make an appointment. thank you snapdragon team!!!!!",5

"yogi noodle by far my favorite chinese restaurant for it being cheap good combos and such. yes you can find restaurant that may have more variety better foods and all, but can you beat yogi with pricing? it's not that you only get what you pay for, you get awesome lunch dinner combos at reasonable price and the place is clean, not ghetto. i don't see why yogi noodle only got 3 stars. it's a five for me, if i didn't mind eating chinese food everyday, i'd eat here everyday.",5
"my favorite breakfast\/brunch spot in madison. very tasty options and good brunch (read: alcoholic) drinks, too. i like the french toast, or breakfast sandwich if i'm in the mood for savory. always a bustling place but it doesn't take long to get seated after you order. it can feel a little chaotic when you first walk in but the staff manages it well. it's a little pricey but worth it in my opinion. 

sitting outside on a farmers market day is awesome! if it's a nice day, definitely try to get a spot outside.",5

"awesome meal and better service. ordered the royal robin. egg on top was cooked to perfection. the waitress brought my endless fries early, like an appetizer. the wife got the smoke and pepper burger. seasoning was just right. for desert we did the towering doh nuts. fantastic with the dipping sauce. best part of the meal was the red head waitress. she was fantastic, funny, and up beat about everything. she really made the meal more fun.",5
"i like the decor of this restaurant, you wouldn't really think its a cafe because how its arrange. well my family and i had arrived at the mandalay bay pretty early hoping we'd get situated in our room, but we didnt we were at the lobby for at least 4.5 hours waiting for our room to be ready. so we had brunch it wasnt too too pack but we did get seated in 10 mins.

i had the baked potato soup and it was pretty good, overall my experience wasnt too bad.",3
"inside is newly remodeled with a nicely updated, open, warm and welcoming environment. sometimes gets crowded especially in the drive through, but what can you expect when the location is between two very busy roads, so i really can't complain or blame the store for the sometimes long wait times.",5
"i tried the spicy thai burrito from this location for lunch today. the location was busy and i was worried it was going to take a while to get my order, but they are pretty fast and efficient at assembling the various salads, wraps, bowls, and burritos. you order and pay at the counter, tell them your name (somehow i became lisa, oh well) and they assemble your order and hand it off to you. there were a few tables at this location, but most people seemed to be taking their orders to go. 

there is a really good selection of wraps, bowls, salads, soups, and burritos. most of the components of these items are vegan or vegetarian. you can get animal or non-animal protein added to your order (e.g. chicken, steak, tofu, falafels). the ingredients all look very fresh, colourful, and healthy.

the spicy thai burrito i ordered came topped with quinoa, cabbage, carrots, edamame, and a spicy thai sauce. they didn't apply the spicy thai sauce evenly so the top half of my burrito was completely lacking in sauce and all i tasted was the fresh vegetables and quinoa. it was tasty, insofar as i enjoy fresh vegetables and quinoa, but it didn't blow my mind. when i got to the bottom half of my burrito and i finally tasted the spicy thai sauce, then i really started to enjoy my meal. that sauce has a nicely balanced spicy kick. i would next time ask for extra sauce and hope that solves the issue of a half unsauced burrito. 

the menu items all look good for you and sound delicious, but if you are counting calories, you might want to consult the nutrition information before you order. my burrito was a very reasonable 480 calories, but some of the other options i was considering were well over 800 calories (a couple of the wraps). the soups and salads all seem to be reasonable in calorie count. you also have the option of subbing out any of the base or wrap for a salad base or collard green wrap. 

the prices were on par with what you'd pay to get a wrap, salad or burrito at other places. i will definitely come back here again to try a few of the other options.",4
"this place is great, the rockys original cheesesteak is off the chain and the mushroom philly is bomb as well. i highly recommend this place, great service and great food also the pizza slice off a 28"" pizza is huge. we will definitely return",5

our favorite mediterranean food in the valley. huge portions for the price. the gyro and swarms combo are our favorite. also recommend the roasted lamb hummus. phoenicia is awesome!,5
came here for a dinner in one of their private rooms. since i was fasting i needed to eat vegan to which they were very accommodating. the potatoes brava were really good along with the winter veggies. people at the table enjoyed their food. i would recommend,4
"a hidden gem in mcgill ghetto neighbourhood. it is a unique tartare restaurant concept, from salmon, tuna, beef, veal to scallop and lobster tartare. you get to choose the weight of the tartare from 100gram to 200 gram and then you get to choose the style from spicy to japanese to russian style.  i thought the concept is very interesting and i love it! 
other than tartare, they have a vast variety of appetisers, main courses which have a asian fusion approach i mean you can get grilled hamachi collar?!!
oh almost forget they hv a raw bar too, oysters, prawn cocktail u name it. 
now this happen in this little restaurant, i think it's amazing. 
service was great, very friendly, the ambiance was happening and high energy. 
will definitely be back.",5
"i visited here a few days ago with a companion. i ordered one of their fried rolls and my partner had katsu chicken with glass noodles. i had a little bit of theirs and both meals were delicious.
dessert was a bit disappointing. we had the green tea ice cream and fried bananas with vanilla ice cream. the bananas were fine, but both ice creams, the green tea in particular, just weren't that good. i got the impression that they were both made in house, which is fine, even desirable, but it tasted like too much matcha went into the green tea ice cream.
i definitely look forward to returning and trying their different rolls and noodles, but i'll be skipping dessert there.",4
"soo, the other day i locked my keys in my car. this is the only set of keys that i have and i couldn't afford to break a window or call a lock smith. i'm stuck. so i called danny's car wash to see what tools the use to get into the car in the case that they accidentally lock keys in a car. 
i was put on the phone with one of the managers and he told me what it was called and asked me how far away do i live. so i told him my cross streets. it's about 3 to 4 miles from there. 
he said ""if you meet me on the cross-streets you provided we'll come save the day""
this made my day. sure enough i met him on the cross streets, and took them to where my car was and within 10 min he had my doors open. thanks for going above and beyond barney and adam! i appreciate that. i will be in for my oil change in about two weeks! 
this may not have much to do with car washes itself, but you see the type of people that work there. fantastic job. 

thank you!",5
"we hosted a group dinner for 14 people  at istanbul sofra on a friday night. reservations made in advance were not on file when we arrived, but the owner was gracious and was willing to accommodate us without any note of inconvenience.  the appetizers were great and the food was delivered quickly. we loved the decor and the ambiance.  a good time was had by all.

the staff are very friendly and welcoming, as is the owner.  this place is much better than the other pittsburgh mediterrian places.  folks who had the dessert, coffee, and\/or tea also said it was great.  

we want to come back just for dessert and coffee!",5
"my first visit, but so good i will become a regular. reasonable prices, large portions, great flavor, fresh vegetables perfectly cooked. and this was the lunch special--i'm looking forward to trying some other dishes. i had the basil green  bean stir fry--several nice pieces of chicken, and the onions and carrots were nicely cooked (not overcooked), but the star for me was the green beans. so tasty, not mushy, just perfect. great friendly service. clean, and welcoming, not at all fancy--even when eating there you are served in to-go containers with plastic utensils. if you're ok with that, i highly recommend this place.",5
"i'd been seeing the sign for this place for a couple of months but thought it was a seafood market. then i drove past it from the southern ave. side and realized it was an eatery. it's located in the former kyoto bowl location at country club and southern. i stopped in to ask info just as they were closing a couple weeks ago and came back yesterday to try them out. 

i found out they had an oyster po ' boy sandwich and ordered it with a side of mac and cheese in place of the fries. a drink even came with the $6.99 price. i really enjoyed the sandwich, good flavor, fresh ingredients. the mac and cheese was a bit mushy but had good flavor and they were generous with the portion. i ate half my meal there and had half left for a second meal. the server, bailey, was extremely nice and helpful in answering questions. we share a love of fairies! i hope to get back to try the shrimp and fish before i leave town. 

this place conveniently located near many motels in the 60 & 87 area. there is a large parking lot right in front.",4
we like the pho special...i don't really know how authentic the place is but we like to dine-in and carry out from here about once a month.,4
"get there early and put yourself on the list because it gets packed on monday nights!  i just found out  they don't take reservations. 
it's also hard to find parking, so you might have to park in the gravel  lot across the street from hula's. 
as far as the food; i'm not really a burger person, but their $3 burgers on mondays are definitely a good value. 
the sweet potato fries were delish. i definitely enjoyed them.
4 stars for good specials, good service and good, friendly environment.",4
"i have been going to ohana for about a year, but mari has been cutting my hair ever since i moved to arizona, which was in 2006.

at ohana, i've had my hair cut and styled (always by mari!), as well as enjoyed their massage and waxing services, and i have to say, they've never done anything but a fabulous job for me. it's true that there are less expensive places you could go in scottsdale for the same services, but it's also true that you get what you pay for, and i say ohana is worth every penny. the place is clean, the atmosphere is fun and chic, and the service is attentive and consistent.

the number one thing i appreciate about the staff at ohana is that they listen to me. when i describe what i want and don't want, they take it into consideration, 100 percent. i'd recommend this salon to anyone -- and i have!",5
"day one of membership: come in to sign up and work out, saturday around 4pm. not too crowded but somehow every machine is taken and as soon as someone walks off, another one comes in. not that big of a deal- i can adapt.
day two of membership: attempted to come on a monday at 4:15pm as soon as i got off work. big mistake, place is packed and there was literally no parking spots. people were overflowing into the streets and nearby gravel to park. the gym inside was felt humid and really warm. yuck
day three of membership: went home after work and sat around until 6:45pm to go to the gym. still very busy but at least i could get a parking spot and hop on a cardio machine right away.

all around, nice gym with all the works. some of the cardio machines stay dirty but i've seen this in most gyms i've been to and can look past. locker room seems to always have towels laying around (not the gyms fault, really, there is a place to put the dirty towels as you walk out of the locker room). the only real negative i can give this place is since there is always so many people working out, i haven't been able to use more than half of the equipment. this makes the price seem a little silly if i can only use select items even at their ""slow"" times. i have to sit around and wait after work to go work out and this kills motivation fast.",4
"if you are a green thumb and loves herbs\/spices, i highly recommend you check out richter's herb in early spring!

i am amused and excited to see all the selections during late fall. i just love the aromatic herbs: there are over 10 different types of lavenders\/basil\/sage\/rosemary and more! sniff sniff sniff! so good for the senses!

i already have a vision. a few herb baskets in the garden that i am going to put together when it is warm enough. 

and for the time being, there are dried herbs and spices that available in packages for purchase.",4
"haymarket wouldn't exactly wow you with its marvellous architecture, but at the end of the day you're most likely there to catch a train than to capture something beautiful on your camera.

haymarket is usually pretty busy, and at peak times you may be swamped by the crowd since it's pretty cramped. nevertheless, it's very easy to figure out and you won't find yourself lost. it's manned with staff who all seem very helpful - they always help me through the gates with my bike when i've got it. 

as far as amenities go, it's not the best. there's the obligatory w h smith kiosk, which is becoming so expensive it's a wonder they're still in business. but since they pitch themselves in stations, they make a massive profit over last minute purchases. 

having to drag my bike down two flights of stairs to get to the platform yesterday, i would testify to it being awkward for people with bikes, carrying lot of luggage, and the disabled. i'm unsure if there's a lift but would sincerely hope there is because if you were travelling alone in a wheelchair it would be impossible to get down those stairs. the staff are helpful, however, so i'm sure they'd give you a hand.

haymarket's saving grace is that it's easy to work out. with only four platforms, you are either travelling north, south or to glasgow. it's clearly signposted so it's difficult to make human errors when you're figuring out where to go. 

it's not blindingly beautiful and perhaps doesn't have the passenger a lot to offer, but it could be a lot worse. service seems to run smoothly here which is largely due to haymarket's great team of efficient staff.",3
"the clams appetizer was good even if they were small.  as for the mafalde bolognese, the pasta was probably undercooked but the sauce was tasty.  i initially thought the pasta was supposed to be harder than most pastas so i did not ask server to take the dish back.  kitchen might need quality control.  service was friendly.",3
"delicious food, nice atmosphere. i was skeptical when looking at the menu and all the vegan offerings (sometimes vegetarian restaurants try a little too hard to be creative), but this was the best sandwich i've had in a long time (sunizona blt). i chose the side of hummus with vegetables; also excellent. the only drawback is it's a little pricey ($13 for a sandwich and side).",4
"love this place.  i love it enough to actually leave a review..
we have been taking away from here for 3 years and have never been disappointed.
while i can't comment on all of the dishes we particularly enjoy the naga curry, it's always flavoursome as is the goan lamb - the lamb has always been tender.  my husband swears by the keema naan and i adore the reliably buttery saag aloo.  the dishes are never greasy and the samosas are crispy and well stuffed.  we always ask for extra chilli as we like it hot and they always oblige.
this place could hold it's own in the city, it is a real treat having it out in the sticks.

i just wish they delivered to oldhamstocks!!",4
"good but expectedly expensive french 'nouvelle' cuisine. service is a bit slow. place is a bit cramped. but the open kitchen runs the show, and everything i tasted there was very, very good. with less audacity than le cinquième pêché, though.",3
"the raw combinations of flavors make a fest in your mouth... drinks are ok. but everything else on the menu is yummers. vegans, stay away.",5
"excellent experience!!! came here for lunch for 7 people! our waiter joe was very helpful & patient! in my humble but accurate opinion the ice tea could have been much, much much better! the strawberry\/banana smoothie was excellent! the hash-browns were a bit greasy but fine enough for us! their sausage gravy was excellent! overall the adults & kids enjoyed their meal experience here!!! by the way kids eat free on tuesdays!",4
"i found everything here (taste, location, servers, ect.) just mediocre. nothing to really complain about, but also nothing to really rave over. even now, as i am trying to come up with a review, nothing is coming to mind. i had a falafel bowl, and was with friends who ordered the chicken istanbul bowl. the friend was absolutely loving the chicken, but i did not try it since i don't eat chicken. as for the falafel, it was good but not memorable...

one thing i do specifically remember is that the sauces were extremely unimpressive. especially the tzatziki-but-not (since they are turkish based) sauce. so watery tasting.",3
"we have never eaten at sonny's before but came in and ordered take out sliced brisket and baby back ribs.   they were excellent.  the lady who took the order was very nice even though she had not worked at this particular store before.  my irritation with this restaurant is they had signs everywhere they were  ""introducing"" their new fried pickles of which i am a huge fan of and i ordered one serving for $4.99 to go.  when i got home, there was not even one pickles worth of slices and it was a very small pickle.  they were tasteless and the little coating was practically raw cornmeal that had slid off the pickle.  instead of putting it in a take out box with holes to let out the steam, it was in a piece of like waxed paper and twisted shut.  pickles are normally served with something like ranch dressing.  not bbq sauce. yuck!  if you are promoting something you better know how to cook it!  fried pickles should be golden brown and the cornmeal should have some salt and paprika or cayenne pepper.  i will never order these again.  doesn't anyone ever taste the damn food they are ""promoting""? what a shame.",3
"i live in the area and ate at the previous dang dee thai quite often. the food was fresh, not oily and delicious. i am a connoisseur of thai cuisine so l know good from bad.
the new place is not good. i am very disappointed. it is more like chinese food now. the dishes are oily, vegetables are over-cooked and the prices are higher by $2.00 per item if not more. 
i ordered mixed vegetables today. i asked for basil and mushrooms specifically and the least amount of oil in cooking as possible. i got nothing l asked for and the dish was floating in oil. you know when a thai restaurant is good by 3 things;  fresh veggies, very low oil in the sauce and not on the plate, as well as lots of flavor. oil masks flavor. 
i'm sorry to say,  l will not be back. this was my second try there. i sure wish it was still dang dee!",1
"probably one of the best places i have been to for sushi. the owners are friendly, personable and welcoming to new comers. every bit of sushi was amazing! the yellowtail sashimi = amazing!!!!!",5

"we lucked out and as we got on like they asked for a any party of two to be seated and since all the party's ahead of us where bigger we got seating right away and at a perfect seat on the deck over looking the view from the restaurant. i enjoyed a flight if beers that i really enjoyed because of getting a little of everything. we order the brie chicken pizza, poutine and brisket burger. the best being the pizza. this was just awesome. great crust and everything on it was just so good. the burger was good but i find for the price it was not very big or loaded with toppings. the poutine was good but could of used a little more cheese. over all the food was good but it really was the service and setting that really got me. some of that being luck and nice weather. i mean this was an amazing view for a good dinner.",4
"ms ellena was rude, never experienced such worst customer service. am never going back to this place. she seemed to pissed that we were there in a large group. she dint give us enough time to decide on what we want to order. may be they including the tip of 20% for large group in the total price was the reason that she dint care about us.",1
i'm new to things like facials and sherise made me feel so comfortable. she explained everything in detail and answered my sometimes stupid questions i left so relaxed. the spa was lovely and relaxing with just the right music playing. very impressed.,5
"my first time at atl wings was a great experience, the staff was friendly and the general atmosphere made for a great time. regularly i would go to atl for wings considering my previous experience but, the last visits were less than average; the fries i was served were ""soggy"" and lacked any seasoning this same issue has occurred on multiple occasions. today i went to atl again, expecting the service to be better but, yet again i was disappointed, i ordered boneless barbeque wings and instead was served bone-in wings yet, i was charged for the boneless wings. the cashier even repeated the order to me stating the wings a boneless.  although my first experience was great, atl's quality has slowly been waning and at this rate i may not return to this restaurant again.",3
"ok, i admit it...i do have a thing for their cheese biscuits.  oh my gosh, fresh from the oven, piping hot, is there anything better than those first few bites?  it is a guilty pleasure for sure!
   
we stopped in on a tuesday evening & were pleased that we were seated immediately at a booth in the bar area.  it was not loud at all & patrick (the bartender) was a wonderful server; attentive without being intrusive.  
the included salad was tasty as always; their salads, though kind of basic, always seem be perfectly crisped & good.  for my entree, i got the blackened wild caught cod which i couldn't have been happier with.  it was perfectly cooked, tender, moist, flaky, yeah pretty perfect.  although the ""wild caught"" fresh fish options are more pricey, i am so glad that red lobster always has a few non-farm raised options to satisfy my obsession with such things.  hey, a nice, healthy wild caught fish cancels out the decadence of (several) cheddar biscuits, right?

the rest of the meal was good also, but i was just content filling up on biscuits, salad & the most perfect, delicious cod : )",4
"excellent customer service!!  if you are looking for a shipping center to help you ship a package, they are really hard to beat.  paul and heidi have helped me many times!  thanks so much!!",5
"i was not that impressed with the place. 

ok, the food was good, but it can get a bit high for your wallet if you eat there a lot. the old montreal is, unfortunately, not that friendly for the people who are tight on the budget, of for the workers in that neighborhood, and titanic is part of the restaurants that are benefiting from the crowd of tourists, but doesn't try to impress the crowd with 'signature plate' or speciality.

nothing really 'popped out' in my mind or amazed me. overall, it's a pretty average café-bistro.",3
"outstanding! a valley legend!

this is one of my all time favorite valley restaurants. great food, very warm and friendly service, and great drinks. 

might i suggest the pollo cubano or the cho cho. the latter may be one of the best kept secrets in arizona.

"i just feel good eating here. it's a bit pricey for me, but i can tell everything i've ordered is made with quality ingredients (and it's good for me!) being a bacon lover, i was a little skeptical of the blt since the bacon is replaced by smoked coconut but once i tried it, i never looked back. i went with a group of both vegetarians and non-vegetarians, and everyone left happy.

favourite juice: the popeye",4
"sweet server who was so helpful!  first off she walked me through the process because i haven't done a hot pot before.  she was so nice and attentive. cute as a button.

the food was interesting and fun. when i got into it i enjoyed it. i tried a lot of new things and all were delicious! 

my favorite items are the lamb chops, fish paste jalapeño and spicy vegi salad.  

the place is very nice, trendy and clean. very comfortable.  

a++++ to the staff!",5
"i'm mexican and from california. since moving to pittsburgh in 2014 bea taco town is no doubt some of the best mexican food i've had here. i absolutely love carne asada everything and usually get it with their tacos or as a burrito. i wish they would sell carne asada fries and carne asada nachos! i've also tried the chicken, chicken with mole, chorizo, shrimp, and carnitas. none of those disappointed either! their rice is also amazing! i grew up eating pinto beans, but bea's sells black beans, and although not what i'm used to, they're pretty good here as well. i do wish the prices were a little cheaper, but that's just because i'm used to cheaper, but still delicious, mexican food from back home. but since bea is the best in pittsburgh, they can definitely get away with the prices!",5
"for a ramen place in the suburbs (not comparing it to downtown places), this place isn't good.  their menu is based on customizability, but the pricing for adding anything is really not worth it.  the portions are extremely small and broth is pretty bad.  the noodles are decent, but the broth tastes like they are using powdered chicken or beef stock as a base.  

i would rate this place higher if their pricing more accurately reflected their food quality, which is low.",1
"fantastic latte, really good berries with a creamy maple dip.  very nice waiter named george.  filet mignon was enjoyed by my husband.",4
"this t&t is probably one of the better ones because the underground parking is pretty convenient for those rainy days and winter months.

i do however find the prices a little more expensive than their competitors.  it's nice that they accept coupons there.  most asian supermarket don't accept them.

the supermarket is clean, however i found the aisles are pretty tight especially around the bakery \/ hot foods \/ sushi area.",3
this place is wonderful i had not been to panera in about 3 years. i use to go to the one located in saint louis every other day. i am addicted to panera and as of today i recall why. the food here is very healthy and when you leave you will be full. i give this five stars because its really going to keep me on track with eating healthy. the quick service and its very clean what more do you need out of life. omg they should give me my own parking space. i wonder do they do that? yes when i pull up in front a space marked sam's space only. giggles a girl can dream. but i must go i'm off to panera i've made myself hungry.,5
extreamly overpriced! food was average at best and took forever to get drink refills.,2

"absolutely incredible hampton. stayed here for a wedding at ashley manor which is nearby. nicest hampton i have ever stayed at. 
(and i have stayed at a lot) service was outstanding! they knew who i was as i walked in. ok, so how do they do that? eric at the desk and gloria at breakfast are like long lost relatives. the bed was to die for. i  really wanted to take that white down comforter home with me.( only kidding hampton-lol) but really where can i get one for my house?  the bed was super comfy and the room is nice. here is how i know this is a top notch place. the electricity went out while i was there because of construction on price\/101. no one seemed upset, the guests were not screaming or angry, and everyone handled it smoothly and calmly. that tells me this is a fine establishment with a reputation for good customer service. sure enough, the lights came back on and everything was great.gloria went around to all the tables  checking on everyone and reassuring them during and even after delivering the food that was in the toaster, waffle iron, etc. way to go gloria! they have a free shuttle so that's a nice added bonus for wedding guests at the ashley manor or super shoppers at chandler mall. i want to go back and have a staycation immediately. oh btw, the homewood suites in the same parking lot is gorgeous too if you need a suite hotel. happy vacationing.",4
"six bucks per shrimp ??? really !

 we made reservations here and the 4 of us showed up for what we hoped was a nice dinner. we were escorted upstairs and shown to our table. i can respect ""minimalist"" decor..... but metal garden chairs ? not particularly comfortable.....but we soldiered on, because we did make reservations. 

our waiter was attentive, until we ordered than he kind of disappeared and we couldn't order additional beverages or get a water glass filled until the $6 shrimp arrived.

so........ about the food. our friends ordered the burger special and a pizza and based on their comments both were tastey. i ordered the shrimp and grits and my wife ordered the scallops and squash hash. each of our meals cost $24 and we were both amazed at how small the portions were. even our friends commented on the appetizer sized portion, mine came with 4 shrimp.... not scampi sized shrimp..... a rather small sized specimen. the scallops were the mini scallops, not even a medium size digby bay type.

full disclosure time......both the scallops and the shrimp dish were flavorful and good..... just too small of a portion for what we paid. 

now as you read this, you may be inclined to think.... ""wow this guy doesn't get out much"" or ""dude it's chagrin falls, you can afford it"", the truth is i travel extensively for business and eat out typically 5 nights a week in all types of establishments, i know what portion size should be. i also know what value is and $6.00 per shrimpy shrimp is not a good value.

my advise get the burger",2
ordered vegitarian enchiladas. terrible. just cheese inside with sauce and it was stone cold. no guacamole. nothing extra. it was my first time coming to this place and it's terrible. i'll stick to pot belly right next door thank you much.,1
"this place is pretty much just your average taco bell on the strip. the only biggest difference is they serve their typical taco bell slushies with alcohol. you can mix and match the slushies and comes with your choice of hard liquor (tequila, whiskey, vodka, rum). according to the server, mixed in whiskey is gross, vodka and rum if you don't want to taste the alcohol, and tequila if you want a good kick to it (although this just made it taste like a margarita). i know they also have additional items on the menu but it's your typical taco bell type bar food, nothing extraordinary.  it's a two story building with seating up top as well as a small shaded patio out front. i guess the cool thing is that you can pick up taco bell merchandise here (i.e. shot glasses, shirts, hats).

probably a place to check out only once if you're a taco bell fan.",3
"came here for some lunch on a saturday

"meh. this place looks nice on the outside but we did not have the best experience here. first of all the reservations...i call the hotel and i'm transferred to someone that does not work at the hotel to make my reservations. they promise me a king room at a great rate for the wedding party i'm with. when i arrive i'm told that i was put with the wrong wedding party and i get a room that is more expensive with 2 full beds. we had a couple other people in our party end up with rooms that they weren't pleased with either. 

also, during our 2 day stay there was some kind of construction going on and there was an ear-piercing drilling that filled our room multiple times each day. i phoned the front desk each time to let them know but it still continued. 

good location and very clean rooms but the service was extremely lacking.",2
"i have to give it a 4 just for the sheer impressiveness of what these people can do.  the way they contort their bodies and the amount of strength they possess in order to do what they do is mind boggling.  however, i was pissed that we bought the most expensive tickets and the ticket person failed to mention that we would be sitting in folding chairs in front of a railing.  that is ridiculous in my book.  plus i thought the show was good but it didn't hold my attention the entire time in order to warrant 5 stars.",4

"visited dr. george rose as a new patient. he does prostate exam on me although i told him a had one a couple of years ago and they found nothing and said to have another one in 10 years. got a call saying that blood was found in stool and he wanted me to have a colonoscopy. i told him i had ""hem"" problems and that was more than likely it. but, i had a colonoscopy done anyway. result, bleeding from ""hem"". no problems, come back in 10 years. i recently tried to refill my prescriptions and was not authorized by roso. they said i had to be seen first.i made the appointment. when the nurse came in to check my blood pressure i made the mistake of telling the nursing assistant that i was getting over a cold and that i went to urgent care. she immediately asked why didn't you come to us. i thought first of all none of your business and secondly i highly doubt they would schedule me within 45 minutes. dr roso came in and i told him about my recent illness and visit to urgent care. he too, asked with a bit of tone, why did't you come here. seems like a bit of desperation from both the na and dr roso. i mentioned i has been up during the night quite a bit with frequent urination. so what does he have to do?, you got it, another needless and costly prostate exam to find out nothing was wrong. remember, he did a prostate exam a few months earlier. do you really think i would of developed issues in a 3 month period??? just another needless procedure to rack up the billing! he prescribed a drug for me to try. my initial thought was i hoped that he would offer a generic if the cost of the drug prescribed was too high. i guess i was spoiled because my previous doctor, dr. hugo fazz, a great doctor, would of never let me leave his office without checking into that. to my surprise when i went to the pharmacy to pick up the script, the pharmacy tech asked me, ""do you know how much this cost""? i said no, she said $275 dollars. hmm, i don't think most of us could afford that every month. a blatant example of lack of care for patient. i asked the pharmacy to ask the doctor for a ""generic"" as a substitute. a couple of days later i came in and asked if he prescribed a generic. they said that he hadn't responded to 2 fax request. i came in a few days later to find out that they tried 5 times and he never bothered to get back to them or me for that matter.

so at this point i know that dr. george roso is not the doc for me. so, i ask the pharmacy to check my meds and ask for a refill if any were at 0 refills. they did just that and guess what? the request denied and he had the gull to require me to visit the office again before he would authorize any refills. what a racket!!!!! and last but not least, on that last visit from out of the blue he asks, ""do i need to check you for std's????? what a horrible display of bedside manner. if your are considering this doctor, you decide for your own and best of luck. you will need it...

sorry that dr. fazz was no longer in network but i will be fine paying out of pocket to have the professional care that is well worth the $$",1

"i go to this starbucks on a regular basis seeing as it is the only one close to where i live and on the way to the freeway. generally i get just regular coffee which for the most part is hard to screw up but lately i've changed it up seeing as it is hot out. my order has changed to iced green tea without sweetener. seems pretty easy right? wrong! normally i don't have an issue with this particular starbucks other than the fact that it is unusually slow. today for instance i ordered two trenta iced green teas no sweetener for my boyfriend and i. there was only one other person in the starbucks at this time, who had come in after i did and one person in the drive-thru. however it took a good 5-8 minutes to get what is an easy drink to make. you pour green tea about a third of the way in the cup fill with water and add ice. the starbucks employees were running into each other and acting as if it was an 8am rush. when my drinks came out my order was right but my boyfriends was wrong they gave him iced black tea and not green tea. we brought this to the attention of the barista and he said he must of poured the wrong one. after another 5-8 minutes over waiting my boyfriend still got what looked and tasted to be black tea. the barista insisted that it was green tea! green tea has a slight orange green tint to it and is a much lighter taste. black tea however is a dark orange brown color and had a bold bitter taste when not sweetened. do to being pressed for time the issue was not pushed any long and my boyfriend left unsatisfied with their service. i miss the days when i would go to this starbucks and they would now my order and get it right every time.",3

i have used mark a few times now and have refereed lots of business to him as well.  i like that i can email him since i have a busy schedule and he gets back to me within a reasonable amount of time.  they do great work and they have great prices on palm trees (i have gotten several bids and he seems to be the best insured service).  i refuse to use these guys that stop by and knock on your door to trim your tree for $10 each since they always look scary to me and i know they will sue me if they fall since i am sure they do not carry insurance.  i highly recommend creative tree care and they have taken great care of quite a few of my friends.  thanks mark!,5
"one of the best burgers i've ever tried.  first of all, this restaurant is usually packed, so prepare for a wait.  second, the decor is adorable!  the cartoon cow graces their windows and in the wall paintings, which creates a fun and relaxed environment.  they have interesting gourmet burgers and sliders and spiked milkshakes!  

my favorite was the rising sun burger - kobe beef with tempura avocado, teriyaki glaze, and sprinkles of furikake.  so many different flavors and textures that worked together.  i also tried the fun-ghi, with portabello mushrooms, aioli, and truffle oil, but it was too much goodness in one that it was overwhelming.  the flavors were too similar and heavy, especially the two thick pieces of gruyere cheese.  the burgers come with a side of either skinny or steak fries.  i recommend the steak fries because their skinny fries are too crispy and almost chip-like.  

don't forget to try their shakes and malts!  i wanted to try their spiked shakes, but got grossed out thinking about alcohol from the night before, so i got a simple vanilla malt, which was thick, creamy and fatty.  yum!",5
"my first experience was good. the food was above average, but the wait time was pretty long. went for a 2nd visit for lunch today and ordered two tacos but had to leave before eating, because the order still hadn't come after 35 minutes! 

the waitress wasn't very nice when asked about the delay in serving my order. the place was only half full. maybe others have had the same experience i had and made the same decision not to go back",1
i walked in to get my tire patched and the service was great. i loved that they advised me that there would be a wait so i had no surprises and the atmosphere made me feel right at home. staff was super knowledgeable and helpful and offered water while i waited. i loved to hear staff enjoying their work and having a good time while being professional and fast. thanks guys for all you do i would definitely recommend to all friends and family keep up the great work!!,5
"i love indian food that's spicy and full of flavor. i came here for the first time with my family after hearing about them rave about it multiple times, and i definitely believe this is some of the best indian food in the valley. 

when we first arrived on a friday evening at around 5:30 pm, the restaurant smelled amazing and the place was relatively empty. i ordered the chicken tika masala, and it did not disappoint! you have the choice between mild, medium, and hot masala sauce - be careful if you order the hot and you're not used to spicy! the dinner portions were huge (i probably could have shared mine with my sister), and i definitely enjoyed everything along with their buttered naan.

this will definitely be the place that i visit when i'm craving indian food. i just wish that they'd fix their website so that i could order online. it'd definitely be a lot easier and more convenient.",4
jade red chicken is to die for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  omg,5
great food. we had a very nice time on valentine's day. we would go back for sure.,4
"so, the chirpy little pharmacist, who informed me a) she had a headache, and b) she wouldn't be filling this she had a headache and was getting off, so it eod be more than an hour, didn't type the scripts in. an hour later i ask how they are coming...,she's gone and i get crickets from the rest of the staff.
 they say i can home back tomorrow, i tell them i am driving to az. they say at least an hour.
 when jaye ran this place this this never happened but the last year it's a too common.
 luckily i can shop elsewhere after this.
 i hope you can too, otherwise you have my condolences.
 other than that, clean, polite, just avoid the cranky midget with a headache.",2
"newsflash!!  after 10 years of living in the east central phoenix area, i have finally found my ""go-to"" greek place.   it's like comfort food, but it's the entire restaurant.  

my cousin and i stumbled into this place --- the location is a bit difficult to find otherwise.  we were waiting for our nail appointment at andy's salon a few doors down and decided to grab dinner since we had time to kill.  little did we know what happy customers we soon would be!   an affordable, local, delicious greek restaurant which quickly earned a #1 rating in my book!  can't wait to go back and try more!  

the woman who took our orders and cooked the food was just so wonderful!  she recommended the spicy chicken pita to me, so i took her word  (see my humble pie review, where i learned my lesson for not following restaurant recommendations!).  it was a great choice!!   my cousin had the gyro pita, which was melt in your mouth delicious too.  we also shared a spanekopita, which was just so fresh and well made.  it was piping hot food, she cooked to order (hold the onions for me!), and the flavors were perfect. 

the portions were great, the hummus was tasty, the pita so soft and perfectly grilled.  the olympic flame has even mastered the use of garlic, which many restaurants seem not to be able to manage.  the only downside to this place is that i guess i won't scare vampires off at night after eating here (see my previous review of eden's garlic grill if you are looking to keep the vampires away), but i will sleep well with a fully belly and leftovers in the fridge for tomorrow!",5
i love my dentist office!! i been coming here for years and i would not change. it's a drive out but it's worth the drive. i definitely recommend this office to anyone. the office staff is super friendly and the doctor is awesome!,5
"my first meal in ""sin city"" has landed my appetite in not only one of the hottest bookmarked businesses in las vegas; but a fast food joint  that i don't see back home. raising cane's are one of the many businesses that las vegas have that the bay area or the entire state of california don't. maybe one day that founder todd graves will work on expanding the franchise to california. hopefully, the bay area will be first. 

i was here and ordered the ""3-strip"" combo. for $6.99, i get three battered boneless chicken breast strips, with a side of fries, spicy dipping sauce and a thick ""texas-style"" grilled toast. i usually get chicken strips from businesses like popeye or kfc, but raising cane's version are a tad better than the other competitors. i also get a fountain soda (coke) with my meal. 

my lunch: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/zfyj83ljkko1dp82kzxkng?select=oifbsmhv9l4uiz7dgtb52g

the meal wasn't too bad to jumpstart my visit in ""hot"" las vegas. 

as i was enjoying my lunch, i was admiring the picture of snoopy embracing with his master charlie brown. ""how cute!""

"this is a wicked place for a casual meal. great service and the food is amazing. most meals come with an appetizer, coffee or tea and dessert to finish off. 

i had the beef and macaroni stew, and started with a cold tomato based soup. i was a bit hesitant on the cold soup, but on a humid day, it really helps to perk up your appetite. 

the stew was good with a hearty serving size and a rich broth. however, the meat was a bit tougher than what i was expecting.  overall, it was satisfying. 

i ended the meal with the creme custard and a nice cup of coffee. 

highly recommend coming here.",4
"those cornbread pancakes are sooooo good! those alone are worth making the drive here! 
went in today with a party of 8 and basically everything is delicious. their smothered chicken was really good. it came with 2 sides, i chose cabbage and collard greens, tried to go healthier since i'm already eating something fried and smothered in gravy. i got to try their yams, it's another must order. 
angie was our server and she did an amazing job :)
definitely going to visit again soon ~",5
"horrible. i've been fighting to get my daughter transferred out of this facility to one that has a doctor on staff while her counselor bobbi argues with me. do not have your loved one with any type of mental disorder go to this place. when i went to go see my loved one after they let me after 12 days she was in far worse shape than she had been when she checked in. meanwhile, river source had been calling me every two days telling me how great things were going. when i finally saw her, she was an anxious wreck the whole time, posting bizarre things on social media, talking about how some girl wanted to beat her up there, and she had asked about the acupuncture and baud therapy and they told her they were booked up. it was clear she was not on her meds. i call the facility and suddenly the story has changed. she's not taking her meds, not participating or showing up to groups, not doing chores but she's an adult and it's her choice so oh well. then they tell me that she asked the nurse for her meds that day and the nurse said no so the counselor coached her to go back and ask assertively and explain she needs them. huh?  go ask the nurse twice for your meds after she turns you away?  i asked to have a psychiatrist see her immediately and evaluate her and was told no, she's an adult and she's not asking for that. i'm shocked at the way they treat family members and clients with dual diagnosis.  this is about the arizona city inpatient location.",1
"not saying it's the company or any employees of the company.....but i had three separate charges to my debit card from beck taxi for fares i had today in toronto, ontario. problem is, i'm in california. my bank recognized they were fraudulent and started declining the card. be careful. pay with cash if you can.",1
i love royal jasmine.   excellent food.  my favorite is curry which is always fresh and hot.,4
"i came here for breakfast buffet and then we were takin so long we got a little lunch. the breakfast was really good, if it was fresh. like i had some o'brien potatoes that were so hard and you could tell they were sitting out for a while. the waffles looked overcooked and my friend would not stop complaining that she couldn't eat her waffles without strawberry sauce. i have been to this buffet many times actually. i only paid $11 and it was worth! they had so many meats like sausages and bacon i was so happy. i would come back to get me sum meat.",4
"vegetarian friendly.  the food was delicious.  we were all vegetarian and they were able to make dishes without egg or fish sauce. we got the red curry and green curry with tofu, pad thai with tofu, and padseeew.  my favorite were the green curry and pad thai and spring rolls.  but all the dishes were tasty.  service was fast.  i will definitely come here next time i'm visiting vegas.  a good choice for dinner if you want some good food at casual venue off the strip",5
"i rented 3 suits at men's warehouse for a wedding. the day we picked up are suites, their was a problem  with one of them. fortunately for me miguel was there, and he took care of it for me. i would recommend men's warehouse to anyone who needs a suit.",5
"the larger version of barhop original..didn't even know that this existed until i tried to take my friend to the smaller version...whig was packed and they brought me here!

as always great selection....a book of drinks bigger than the one page. menu of food is always aces in my book!!",4
"the ramen was absolutely amazing. the soup was rich but not too overwhelming, and the meat wasn't dry or anything. their service was really good and always wore a smile. 

the cake was great too. i loved the flavour and the bits of sakura flowers in it. was just the right amount of sweetness. very refreshing!

recommend!",5
i love this good will. the staff is usually very friendly and they stay on top of the store keeping things picked up off the floor and organized. prices are ok and they never forget to ask you for your rewards card.,5
"love the food but need much improvement in customer service! arrived at 7:41 pm to order takeout. left at 8:27 with food! no ""i'm sorry"" or anything from servers at takeout counter (which is where i stood ignored for most of my wait). if there was anyone ""in charge"" at the bar\/takeout counter, they must have been on break the entire time i was there.",2
"every time i've been here i hear the nurses and doctors constantly bickering in the back, nobody seems too happy to be working here, lots of negativity in the air. i'm currently looking for another doctor, hopefully in a happier place.",2
"i have ordered food to go several times. the food is always fresh and extremely tasty. the food is delicious, although overpriced. however, they have issues when it comes time to pay. i have 3 times out of 3 waited at least 5 minutes to get my tab paid. the system used is ill conceived. i understood when they first opened. last week (jan 28, 2014) after waiting 8 minutes to pay the tab, is inexcusable. they also have not had the food ready by the time they suggest i come. this also needs to be ironed out. i have never eaten at the restaurant, so i can not comment. so excellent, tasty food that is a bit too pricey, is still well worth the likely wait you will encounter when you pick up the food.",4
this hotel restaurant is fantastic. i will say with 100% confidence that this is the best breakfast that i have ever had. the omelet station is superb and the breakfast potatoes are full of flavor. they were very patient with my 3 children and were very helpful. i can't wait to stay here again.,5
"i came here for easter sunday brunch and it was nice, the food was yummy. my friend got the seafood crepe and i got the beef bourge bene which was so yummy and tasty. 
our server cheryl was really nice but geez the staff at the hostess stand had a snappy attitude. overall a good experience. if you intend to sit at the patio you have to join the waitlist they don't take reservations for that area. best to make a reservation if you just want to try the food anyway.",3
"super friendly and fast. what else do we need to say? head for this border, they'll take care of you!",5
i'd like to give this place a better review because it looks like they are trying to be successful. the decor is outstanding and ambiance is perfect for a nicer bar setting. my husband and i visited during the lunch hour and took over an hour and a half from beginning to end. this is unacceptable if this establishment expects to cater to someone on their lunch break. the server was friendly but hardly prompt. our drinks were empty longer than they should've been and my chicken sandwich looked and tasted like an old piece of cardboard-like chicken had been sitting around and the cook dropped in in some hot oil and put it on a bun (it didn't get eaten). the only upside is that the cheese curd appetizer was outstanding... the decor and the cheese curds are the only reason i gave two stars.. this location has seen many different restaurants come and go and i hope this place gets it together soon so they will succeed.,2
i love seafood and bloody marys i get both of those things here! the seafood here is always fresh and i feel like i'm close to the ocean whenever i eat here. don't wear super nice clothes here because you might splatter on yourself! and its a first come first serve basis so if you get there late you might miss out on some tasty blue crab!,4
"i stumbled upon these guys since i have a home warranty on one of my homes.  they responded quickly.  franklin is awesome and communicates everything!  i told him i will keep his card in for my other properties.  well...he was just there this am.  i called yesterday and franklin called back with an hr.  he was going to head out there asap!  but my tenant needed this am. great great services and reasonable price.  i am thinking of even doing a yearly check to keep things working properly.  
i love it when small business are so great!  leo (owner) and franklin...great!  leo is very lucky to have such a friendly and dedicated employee!!  i will use them all the time for my garage issues (3 properties).  and i will tell all my neighbors!!!

thanks!!!!",5
"here on a mini mid-week staycation. the room is clean, modern and the hotel has always been non smoking, so no scent of smoke abounds.  this may not be the mirage or palms place in vegas but it is decent for arizona standards.  just wish you could play real craps here but apparently the tribes did not negotiate craps and roulette in the compacts with the state. guess that is good news for las vegas. anyway, back to the staycation. we hope to win a lot of money.",4
"update: my husband went back and spoke with the manager, who insisted that there is no way they can accept paper vouchers despite the fact that yelp states that they can. caveat emptor.",2
"the staff was amazing i must say.  we've been wanting to try this place since opening day but always looked very busy.  our wait time was only about 30 minutes. it's a beautiful building, just not sure why in az especially they wouldn't have built room inside to wait for a table. our waiter was outstanding. i wish all restaurants had service like his. the food really wasn't anything great. i was looking forward to this amazing meal with all the customers i see daily flooding the place, but no, not great.  my salad was pretty much a head of iceberg lettuce with a few ""homemade"" croutons that were just dried out garlic bread, a little chicken, and a pinch of cheese. i ate about half then gave up on it.  pizza was a thin crust that didn't have much flavor.  my husband's lasagne was very good he said, not the greatest, but good. was a pretty small portion he pointed out. my girls liked their fettuccine but just left the leftovers behind. i don't see us eating there again.",3
"lol i'm sorry i love me some new ho king
this is my fav greasy spoon chinese takeout place
to top it off i always get the same food and love every bite.
even though we could never finish it in one sitting we still order waaay too much food
chicken balls, chicken wings, fried rice, cantonese chow mein, and general tso chicken
all delish, all full of flavour, huge portions, greasy and full of salt, just finger licking good
well i will admit i did not like the general tso chicken, it was kind of hard and dry inside. the sauce trys to mask the horrible texture and the fact that its probably old \/overcooked
but my bf loved it so i don't know
lol my mom would so frown at me if she knew i still eat this she hates the msg overload
i'm srry mom its late, i'm hungry and most off all my eyes are bigger than my stomach
see attached pics",4
"the few recent negative reviewers must have been on meth ... this place rocks and does not dissappoint.  i would eat at pisces over rusan's any day of the week.  at lunch, rusan's has their sushi sit out buffet-style, which to me is unacceptable for seafood.  at pisces, it's made to order and extremely fresh.  

by the way julian e., if you are a hungry guy, go there during lunch.  it's all you can eat for just under $12.",5
"gross. went here a few times due to having coupons, etc, and the bads far outweigh the goods. i'm a total believer in chinese buffets, and i'm not one of those types that is like oh my god buffets are gross i don't like any of them so here's a 2 star review cuz i get grossed out by everything that's not tgi friday's. but.. ocean buffet is inconsistent, not that awesome of a value, and they are sooo cheap with the sushi.. there are only about 10 little pieces out for the pickin's available at any time, and they aren't quick to make more.. a few of the seafood dishes served at the buffet are decent, but they can be had elsewhere, and are fresher, and with an atmosphere that feels far less stabbier. this review is based on 3 visits over the course of 2 months...",2
my firends in phoenix brought me out to bs west on saturday night. well its buy 1 get 1 and they give you a chip for whatever you buy. i thought that would mean the drinks would be crappy but they were really good and strong. the same strippers were there and the music was good. its a small club but i had a really good time. there is a parking garage right beside it which is super convenient. i couldn't drive home and the rental was fine there overnight.,4
"the cafe equivalent the guy who turns up at the office in a hawaiian shirt and sits in a bath of baked beans for comic relief, loopy lorna's may be a far more interesting coffee shop than most. sadly, it has the type of character i just find irritating.

it's johnny depp. it's the word ""random"" used continually and out of context. it's a cupcake with pink icing and glitter on top of it.

it's not bad, at all. it's just not for me.",3
"i had seen photos from friends of the pancakes and chicken adobo fried rice. i insisted my local friends take me here on my most recent trip to vegas. we went super early on a sunday morning to beat the crowd\/line and sure enough there was no wait at all and we got to pick our table. i was so torn between crepes or pancakes, so settled on the lemon ricotta pancakes which reminded me of a slightly thicker swedish pancake with more tart flavor from the citrus. i also got a side of bacon because, protein. house coffee was very good as well. my friends got skillets and omelettes, and the bacon pancakes (cue jake from adventure time! bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes, take some bacon and i'll put it in a pancake, bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make, bacon pancaaake!). everything looked so good, and from what i had, pretty darn good stuff. i will be back, babystacks.",5
"is there a 6 star button??! i went to desert ridge with my sons, 12 & 15, for a music assignment for one of them. we were trying to decide where to eat when i spied this little place off to the side. i saw ""paris"" and knew i had to try (i love french pastries)! as soon as we got close, i saw the macarons...yup, had to go in. the owner was a very pleasant man, and he recommended flavors for us. my oldest is in his 3rd year of french so i told him he needed to ask for his choice in french! a bit reluctant as he didn't want to ""mess up"", but he did anyhow. he then proceeded to share a bit of conversation with the owner. i loved it! i told him we'd definitely be back (which we will!) and my son will be ordering for us :) after our dinner at island burgers, i pulled out the little pink box. we devoured them...salted caramel, lemon, apple pie (very sweet but good), cinnamon, coconut, and earl grey (my favorite). i also got a pastry called cannele bordeaux...wow, amazingly good. not only were the desserts extraordinary, but the gentleman owner was a delight to talk to, and i enjoyed his interactions with my son. i highly recommend this place!!",5
"back in the good ol' meat eating days, this place was bomb-diggity. i love the custom burger option, and it's really wonderful to have a ton of different bread styles. that  might be my favorite part. 

unfortunately for me, i am fairly uncreative when i am left to my own devices, so they have some great specialty burgers to offer too. deliciously addicting fries, zesty soda's, and top of the line service. best ""cheap burger"" place, hands down.",4
i love coming here! the food is great and i love the service. i always ask for savanna when i come. she is extra helpful and gives me a five star experience every time!,5
"great job by j2! returned calls quickly, called with updates and confirmed. carpet looks like new and got stains out that i thought would not. highly recommend! thanks j2",5
lots of unique and good flavors. they are very friendly and work with you individually to try and find you flavors you like. nice local place to get juices that you will actually enjoy. resonable prices and selection.,5
went in again for mother's day- cynthia took care of us- service was 5 star! food was incredible. so happy we live right around the corner of this amazing restaurant!!!,5
"wow...the customer service here on a saturday late morning was ridiculously terrible. no greeting, no smiles, no personality whatsoever! the girl preparing the food simply set our items on the counter without saying a word or making eye contact. i guess it's up to the patrons waiting for their orders to figure it out...i don't think i've ever experienced anything like this before. it's a good thing dq is a yummy treat! maybe reconsider your staffing decisions.",2
"i love the pancakes here and the ice tea. great service. too bad i can't give them more than 5 stars for the best pancakes i've had in any restaurant in arizona!

when i was leaving i asked to have my parking violated which is a service that they provided in the past. the hostess said they ran out of stickers and i need to walk over to the gym and ask them to violate my parking. i asked to speak to the manager. he said this is something they do all the time. he offered to go with me. i was not happy. i did go to the gym and the nice young lady at the desk said ask if i was a member. she was nice to help me.

"i started using bulwark exterminating in 2007. the exterminators have never been anything but professional and thorough. we had an ant infestation that year in the kitchen and they came back again to get that under control. my last exterminator, maxime (max) pierre was just as good as the others that have serviced my home. i would recommend bulwark to anyone needing exterminator services.",5
had the best time ever!!! every dish was wonderful and creative. this will be my restaurant of choice every time i go to vegas because they change their menu every season.....i'll be looking forward to summer :),5
"i have a $15 certificate and willing to have this new place a try. the waiter was nice and polite. but he didn't took the appetizer plate and soup bowl away even after we push them to the side of the table and had tissue in there. however, he did refill our bubble tea with no charge. 
for the taste. they definitely need to do better than these. we had padkeemao and another noodle with soup(i forgot the name). first of all, the noodle was a little bit undercooked. then the beef didn't taste very good. and for a level 2 spicy, it was too much( i usually eat medium spicy). 
the goyoza was pretty good, i'd have that 5starts. tom yum soup was fine too, but how can you go wrong with soup? 
over all, this place is alright, but there are way too much other better options downtown for lunch.",3
"i have been talking my 2 cars there for several years and have been quite pleased.  prices are reasonable,  service is fast along with a free car wash. they are friendly and accommodating. best i have been to in a long time.",5
"moving into a very large home, well... you need lots of furniture. i love this store. every time i enter the doors, i walk out buying something. we bought new mattresses, sofa for formal living room, dining room chairs, couch for guest house, craft room storage, bedroom chair, ottoman, bookshelves, etc.. they get new inventory daily, and their prices are very reasonable. i am happy to have found this store. i have went to the other 2 stores in las vegas, but i really like this location and their inventory\/pieces the get over the other locations, just a personal preference..",5
"the quality and order accuracy varies so much its no longer worth it.  used to love this place but the last several orders have been more than disappointing.  usually get delivery through order it, they rarely get it right even though its typed out for them to read.  the owners have attitude problems and its evident as the staff turnover is so high, no wonder there is no consistency in quality.

save your money, go elsewhere.",2
my wife and i go here a lot. she really loves it. she gets chicken swarma. always pretty good. i get gyros pita. ordering gyros here is very hit and miss. they leave it on the spit way too long. today my gyros was crispy. how can it be crispy? ridiculous. some days it's melt in your mouth and awesome. it's about 50\/50. i guess they don't want to throw away food. christina's on chandler blvd and lindsey is way more dependable for gyros.,2
"i have been to this facility numerous times for service....i have never gotten such awesome customer service! from the moment i walk in till the time my vehicle was ready this gentlemen new how to keep me inform and didn't suggest any other repairs that i didn't need. he prioritize what needed to be done & what could wait. before he cash me out, he explain what was done,advise me he had set up an appointment for my next online change, thank me for coming to pepboys and shook my hand. wow!!!! excellent customer service!!!!",5
"every time we come to vegas, we have to eat here at least once!  there were no dinner spots available for reservations online so we decided to just come for lunch on the friday we were in town.  we made it right before noon and was seated right away.  yay!

we always get the garlic black pepper chicken wings for the appetizer.  it is so tasty and the chicken stays juicy.  our daughters loved them.  

for our lunch entrees, we ordered the pad se-ew, thai fried rice and yellow curry.  everything tasted great.  the curry had just the right amount of spice to it (not burn your tongue off so you can't enjoy the food).  the portions are reasonable but if you love to eat, you should order an extra dish.  the 4 of us (2 adults, 2 little kids) almost finished all the food we ordered.  we had a bit of leftovers that we took back to the hotel.

service was a bit slow but i guess they are just really busy.  it got packed pretty fast after we were seated.  come early for lunch or else be prepared to wait a bit!",4
"this store had a nice selection of stuff. it's not the best store, and i certainly won't drive out of my way to buy my supplements from here.

i was in the area and needed some extra b12 and some preworkout powder (i use jack3ed). they didnt have the stuff i use, so i was about to leave, when i saw a sale on resveratrol. i bought some because i know it can pump you up. and also prevent cancer. i hate cancer. 

in any case, the guys working behind the counter were your typical meatheads. the kind who work out a little too much. they are bursting out of their dress shirts. probably take their workouts a bit too seriously. the kind who go to the gym with workout diaries and call eachother ""brah"". not really my thing. 

i'd come back if i had no other choice, but i'll stick to my gnc's and max muscles.",3
"yum yum and more yum!

gosh...219 reviews? what more can i add?? all i can say is this is a must if you visit vegas. the food is delish...especially the crab legs and kobe beef. their dessert buffet is huge too. sucks they ran out of chocolate covered strawberries. =(

tip: the line on a weekend can get very long. i suggest you go there early or ask someone to wait in line for you. you can't be seated until you pay for everyone in your party.",5

"i have stayed at this casino two times, and when i went back i kept thinking why i did not go back right away after the first time, and yes i remember why. this place nickle and dimes you for everything from asking for a roller-bed for $30 dollars more to only allowing you to get 2 more blankets to if you have more than 2 people in the room otherwise they charge you $50 per person. for a person who enjoys to get away to vegas to relax and to stay at this place and then you hear a great deal of ""nos"" this is not the right place. i got say though the place is beautiful and the suite amazing, but the service is just not wanting. i might stay here again it just really depends on if my husband wants to i will avoid it to all costs",2
"i'm really glad i was able to dine at cure twice before moving away from pittsburgh. i think their menu is always changing so i won't go so much into the details of what we ate (other than the oysters -- best i've had so far and i grew up in california) but i felt compelled to write something about this place because it really set the par for what a great dining experience is for me. every plate was a complex mix of unexpected flavors and service was fantastic. you are definitely in for a ""foodie"" experience if you dine here.",5
"i go to safeway at this location to use the pharmacy but every now and then i will do some food shopping as well but since they are crazy expensive that is rare.  

i like the pharmacy because its not as crowded ( busy ) and the staff are nice and very friendly plus most of the time when you drop of your script they will have your script ready in 10-15 minutes.

additionally, you do earn gas rewards.  its the same program as fry's.  they also participate in the $4 generic program for certain medications but just make sure they apply the discount they tend to ""forget"".  

they close at 8pm and i believe a little earlier on sunday's.

for what its worth, safeway pharmacy at this location is a-ok.",3
"what was ordered:  first time- black 'n' blue, caramelised sweet potato fries, and bacon chips. second time - pepperoni burger and caramelised sweet potato fries

service: very friendly employees

cleanliness: place was clean even though there was very busy

taste: the first time i went it was amazing, food was great and cooked perfectly. second time i took the food back to my hotel and the food was not that great. this type of food is only good when you eat it as soon as they serve it. 

worth the price?:  burgers are about 8.50 - 10. reasonably priced.

recommendations: the caramalised sweet potato fries are amazing! make sure you eat them while they are warm because they can get soggy and mushy.

will i come back?: i am from the states and if i had the opportunity to go back to scotland, i will be there in a heart beat. 

tips and notes: do not use take away!!!! even though it is extremely busy i recommend that you wait and the food there, it completely changes the flavor.",3
best tax service ever! riche is very professional and yet has a sense of humor. they even have cookies in their office! i would definitely recommend riche for any one who is looking for reliable and professional tax service.,5
"came here after seeing the positive reviews

jerk chicken is delicious. cooked really well and excellent flavors. its probably the best that i've had. 

oxtail dinner is really good as well. as others mentioned, the meat just falls off the bone... i didn't even use  my knife once. the sauce was great too. 

and to top it all off, extremely good value and friendly service!",5
"this place is a hidden jewel. they have good food at great prices. it's hot, fresh and lots of it. it is not a fancy place. there are no daily specials. just a great place for the time challenged that want a good meal. 

it is family owned and run. everything is prepared and cooked on the premises. can't go wrong having a meal here.",5
"this is usually my favorite starbucks, it's a shame that their employee today told me a lie that has to be repeated here.  i pull up to the drive-thru this evening, and they tell me that they're out of chai, and that so are all the other starbucks in the area.  this sounded like bullshit, so i drove to the next closest starbucks, and what did i find?  chai!

why the lies, starbucks?",2
always a nice & helpful staff. they have a good selection of liquor. they've had everything i've ever wanted. they also offer military discount which is a plus. definitely my go-to if i'm not purchasing on base.,5
"this was not what i expected at all!  the space is huge!  they have plenty of room for large groups, that is for sure!  
there is an actual bar area, which was pretty crowded on a friday afternoon.   we got a table.  my husband and i shared a flight of five beers.  we are partial to the wheat and belgium style so we tried all of those.  i was very impressed.  we both picked our favs and ordered a pint with our lunch.
they have a great menu!  it is pretty chilly inside, so i had the lentil soup to try to warm up.  (there are huge garage style doors that they open in the warmer weather. cant wait for that) my husband got a sandwich with different kinds of pork and bacon.  we also got the pretzel bits with cheese and mustard which were my fav!  one bad thing was the ""cheese sauce"" they served with the pretzels.  b a d  but the pretzels themselves were perfect.  
i cannot wait to go back in the spring\/summer when the weather is warmer.",4
"best boutique for babies and moms! the owner and staff are very knowledgeable and friendly - they really take the anxiety out of being a new mom. they also back-up their products, unlike other boutiques. they deserve 6 stars!",5
i just got my hair done by melanie and although i usually don't leave reviews i have to say how amazing she is! i've had a hard time finding a good hairstylist and to find someone who is so amazing with cut and color i'm ecstatic!,5
"they charged me 15 gbp to box my leftovers?!?

the food was good and the atmosphere was authentic.,  service was polite and quick. i think all indian and thai restaurants should not charge for rice (like in the us), but i get that i am not in the us.  it is obscene to charge carry out container and packaging of 15 gbp. what the hell? i've never heard of such a thing! it was as much as the coat of my food!!!! that's crazy!",3
"i really wasn't sure what to make of this, before we went - but then loved it!
it's nicer inside than i imagined, cosy with long tables. and the wings are just delicious - we tasted about seven different types and they were all great. 
not ideal for a first date, i'd suggest - getting sauce all over your face isn't a great look ... but it's great - go and try it...",5
"huge portions, great service! decor is really outdated, but overall a good place to get a big breakfast on a sunday morning!",4
this is the best thai food i have ever had we had gone back several times to be sure it wasn't a fluke but it's just as good every time we go. the service is friendly and absolutely phenomenal. i just can't wait to go eat each time,5
"worst experience. ever. 

we were blatantly ignored for the first 10 minutes while we stood awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant's floor. when i asked the server behind the bar if we should seat ourselves her response was, ""i would prefer if you didn't."" following which she continued to ignore us. a group of three patrons asked what we were doing because we were hovering around their table making their meal uncomfortable, at which point the same server who i had spoken to came over to deliver some food to them, ignored us again and then went on to clear a table (of the wrong size for our group) rather than acknowledging us. 

there were 2 open tables at the back, which would have been large enough to accommodate our group of 3 - so having been repeatedly ignored and told not to seat ourselves we left. 

i will be sharing this horrific experience with all of my friends to ensure none of them eat there. stay posted for the review of the restaurant we wound up at, which acknowledged us.",1
"this place is just amazing! you pay for what you get!!!! large selection of food from all types of cuisines... endless dessert bar as well! make sure to go early especially on a holiday weekend, be prepared to wait several hours! if its a non holiday its shouldn't be too long of a wait! 

staff are great and friendly! 

this is the place to have one of the best buffets i've had in vegas!",5
this place is really really popular and for a good reason. the location is in a pretty grimy location and parking is less than ideal. if you were planning on coming here you are making a great choice but just plan for either a long walk or arriving early.,4
"well, can't say much for the food because i didn't eat here. which is such a huge disappointment, i was super looking forward to it after hearing so many good reviews, as well as having really great expierience with the crew at dj's butcher block. but, that's the exact opposite for dj's sandwich shop. the 2 person staff made me and my friend feel so uncomfortable and unwanted we just decided to leave. 
when we walked in, there were about 4 customers waiting for to go food. we seated ourselves at the bar, neither the guy or girl working greeted us in anyway other than slightly side eyeing us and looking annoyed we were there at 1:00 in the afternoon. as soon as we say we realized there was a cell phone at my friends seat, so i said to the guy- is this someone's cell phone? is someone sitting here?

now, the tone of voice to which he replied ""that's the store phone"" and with and irritated gesture slid the phone across the counter away from us, looked at the girl and said ""can you get them drinks?"" to which she just sort of dumbly stared at us, and turned back around and continued doing whatever she was doing and not acknowledging us. 

it was so awkward and uncomfortable my friend turned to me and said ""this is weird. i really don't want to eat here. to which i completely agreed, and we left. no acknowledgement of us leaving either. 

seriously, look into your staff, because they suck at human interactions. i won't be back.",1
very happy with service. showed up on time and was extremely professional. cortland did a great job. will be using in the future.,5
"i've been here a couple times now. while the atmosphere and space is great, the menu has been hit or miss. the miso eggplant was a hard pass. honestly looked like a dead sea animal slathered in topping. it was sliced but not all the way through which made it next to impossible to eat with chopsticks. we pretty much had to fight to tear it to pieces. the taste wasn't bad but the longer i looked at it, the harder it was to eat. my partner really enjoyed the inferno ramen. definitely high on the spicy scale, which we love. the noodle texture is slightly gummy, if you care about that. the miso ramen left a lot to be desired. the curry ramen on the other hand, is great. by far my favorite. i come back specifically for that.    the nitamago egg was absolutely amazing. overall excited to see what is to come from this place!",4
"the bread is ok, lacks flavor, salt, something....but the chocolate almond croissants are to die for...lite lunche fare , salads, sandwiches but overall always a good experience....",4
"love this place... highly recommend. bummer that they are closed on tuesdays as that's when i seem to crave it the most. lol.  always taste fresh. staff is friendly.  love the small local feel.  the pho is delicious every time. i love the p3 which has brisket as steak while my girlfriend love the p8-seafood pho.  they do get pretty busy during peak times, but trust me it is worth the wait.  i never knew soup could pack such a flavorful punch.",5
great place! i went in for a tire pressure check. i was in and out in less than 10 minutes and was given a bottle of water. free! great service nice employees i come here for all tire stuff. :)  thanks discount tire guys.,5
"horrible horrible service !!! 
skip this place. i have never been in a place where i was not checked on .. we like the other kj better. horrible ! 

might as well serve ourselves",1
"this was chinese food, which was a total surprise, since it is called a thai grill. i ordered kung pao chicken, which wasn't spicy at all and kind of bland. my wife had the lemon chicken which was pretty good, but not great. i was pretty disappointed that the only thai food on the menu was pad thai. oh well. it was worth a shot.
the fellow who worked there was quite a character, and was fun.",2
was pretty skeptical about coming here after seeing such bad reviews but my husband and i went for breakfast and the food was really good. service was amazing and the atmosphere was very comfy! definitely will come back,3
"this is some of the best pizza that i've ever had, i'm so glad that i ordered from them, when i come to vegas next time i will order from them again.",5
i had a great experience at this location. my car was in the shop for 3 weeks and carlos was awesome!!! he kept my insurance company updated and got me a nice brand new suv to drive and was always available  to answer questions etc.. i would highly recommended this location.,5
"my food was probably 2.5 starts, but between the service (slow to non-existent) and being told that fries or onion rings were included with my meal and then being charged for them? sorry, not returning. definitely worth $18.00 for lunch.",1
"we had problems with the office. they seem very unorganized. we made several service calls because of things that needed fixing in the apartment, and we would have to call 3-4 times before they sent someone. they sometime even blew it off completely! we also had issues with conservice way over billing our water and sewage, the office acknowledged the problem and reassured us not to worry about it and just pay the normal amount. yet, now, i'm moved out and i get an astronomical bill saying i owe them for that. this is just to name a few problem that occurred while renting from them. 

as for the apartments themselves, the shower was embarrassing. literally painted on. the interior amenities were very cheap. fake wood floors, and the wall implements such as the towels racks fell out, our entire breakfast bar counter fell off at one point, very old washer and dryer that broke soon after moving in. the cabinet doors would frequently come off. i just think for what we paid, things like that should be of a higher quality. our apartment got unusually hot most of the time, too. 

i would not recommend this place. they need to get it together. they're a nightmare to rent from. never again.",1
"loved it. i had nothing but a good experience at the spa. i had read the reviews here on yelp(as well as elsewhere) and became a little hesitant, but i was extremely surprised. 

for one, you don't have to walk through the casino to get to the spa. if you self park or valet off canyon rd., there are doors for ""hotel registration"", which is right before the spa, as well as the stinky, loud casino. the facility was extremely clean, the pools were clean and working, the staff was professional and courteous. 

i had a detox seaweed wrap, a refresher facial, wax, mani, and pedi. all of my girls were sweet and very professional. during the seaweed wrap, my therapist made sure to keep my lady parts covered and that i was comfortable. i absolutely adored this treatment and recommend it. my esthetician showed me the products she used and gave me a pamphlet of the products. this was my first facial, so i had no idea what to expect.  they have you lay in a warmed bed, under the covers, which got a little warm, but i think that's the point. it was nice and relaxing. my manicurist was very thorough on my feet(which needed it!)and did such a great job on my french mani. 

there's no skimping, no rushing, no pushy sales people. there are personal lockers, you can use the facilities all day long if you wish. they offer fresh fruit, tea, water, and a number of canned, chilled juices. the staff was always attentive. 

i didn't use any of the other amenities, so i can't say that sauna or steam room worked, but i'm sure it did-others were enjoying the indoor pools and steam rooms. 

i would have given aquae sulis five stars, but i have nothing to compare it to. this was my first spa experience and it was well worth it. i would highly recommend it.",4
"visiting from toronto, i was really impressed! the amount of tickets to be won was incredible. we usually got 200 tickets per play on average. compared to playdium here, that's awesome considering i'd win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets. the food is great, the place is clean and the games don't feel greasy or nasty from all the food.",4
"booked bottle service at the foundation room with wes. i had issues with the evening. i emailed him letting them know just how unhappy i was.

i received several phone calls and emails from jeff, the co-owner of the company and due to human error my contact phone number was not correct, which is the main reason they had problems calling me between 7 and 8pm.

jeff went out of his way to resolve my issues and we will definitely use red carpet vip when we visit vegas again in february.

as a customer service manager, it isn't always about the money but the service we provide, which is exactly what jeff said to me and i agree!

so thank you so much for reaching out to me to resolve my concerns.",4
"worse bar service i've yet experienced.

usually here with a friend because i'm not a fan of the place. my buddy wanted to grab a few drinks and protein as we passed by the area... big mistake lol. as soon as we sat at the bar, i already had a bad vibe with the guy taking our order just by the way he stared at us. it was like he was reaching into our souls trying to tell us to leave. after conversing and finalizing our order while indulging our first round, we began to notice no one passing by to take our order. while waiting, we couldn't help but notice the 'lighter side' of the bar having full\/persistent service. during the long wait, we also got to see our bartender converse with the servers more than the customers. next thing you know, what was supposed to be a few drinks turned out to be just one, and with no pre-mature chicken wings in our bellies. check please!

ps: the extra star was for the eye candy.. not including the ones wearing jerseys.",2
would not eat here owner rude after checking in they would not accept the $10 off coupon offered by this yelp app. service was not poor food way to over priced!!!!,1
"my group and i ate here on friday this holiday weekend- it was the night of our arrival and we were all pretty hungry as it was well past our normal dinner time.  we had great service from the minute we arrived from the hostess and after we were seated by our two servers.  i ordered the thai lettuce wrap and greek salad and both were well seasoned with fresh lettuce and delicious chicken (the lettuce wraps) and yummy sauces and dressings.

my oldest ordered the filet with an added lobster half-tail and the steak was a perfect medium with not too much sauce and good seasoning.

youngest ordered the ham and cheese omelette that arrived wonderfully fluffy and full of ham.  

my daughter's boyfriend ordered the bacon cheeseburger and for a kid i hardly ever see eat?  he polished the entire thing off- i don't know if he was just super hungry or if he enjoyed it that much or both.  he's kinda quiet...

overall, we had a lovely experience and would definitely return in the future if i see myself staying at the bellagio again.",4
"we stopped by here for a snack before going to our next appointment. i had the snack size with gravy. the gravy tasted overly salty, like store bought gravy. it wasn't yummy. my mil makes better gravy. the fries were fine but i couldn't get over the gravy. hubby had the poutine with chicken in snack size as well & enjoyed it. the decor here is all white, red and black. it's clean and bright but i find the colours a bit glaring for my taste. maybe next time i'll try the mushroom gravy. that might taste better.",3
when some guy was trying to lure us in telling us it was only $20 to get in and an open bar all night we were skeptical....but we went and long and behold.... open bar!!!! anything but shots.......  any drink any alcohol.... just not shots!!!! i was in heaven.... good music and the people were so nice.  i took off my jacket and left my purse on a couch and everyone took care of my stuff...drama free....,5
"wow. husband and i split the lord have mercy!, added brisket, and had sides of mac & cheese, succotash, and cornbread. we wanted to try a little of everything since it was our first time. 
brisket, pulled pork, both style of ribs, hot links, and chicken were all delicious! meat was tender, ribs were falling off the bone, and the sauce selection was great. 
the mac & cheese was incredible. probably the best i've ever had. succotash was okay- not very warm. cornbread and honey butter was great. the bread was not crumbly and the butter wasn't too sweet. 
definitely want to go back to try desserts: fried banana split, strawberry shortcake sandwiches, and key lime pie in a mason jar? count me in!!",4
"i love this place!  the selection of both cigars and alcohol is great!  the decore is relaxing, and most of all it is female friendly.  :)  every staff member i came across was pleasant and helpful.  if you've got time to spend there relaxing, i would do it.  it is not close to me and i still go every chance i get.",5
"we took our five year old son to pch because his eyes had swelled and his tonsils were also so swollen they were visible from the back of his neck. we arrived at 10am and were back in a room to see a dr. at 1:30. then two different doctors cames and examined my son two different times. one of them returned and collected a sample from his throat and left the culture in our room and had to return to get it. she then came back and said the test was negative  and wanted to collect urine. i dont know why she couldn't of got both initially but i asked my son to pee in a cup and his mother led him away.  before the ""physician"" left i asked her if my son took drink something now as we were told he could not when we first arrived and were checked in. she said she didnt know but would return with an answer and to collect his urine sample.  after 45 minutes i asked what the wait was to collect urine and the physician returned and i asked her  again if my son could have something to drink as his lips had begun to crack and bleed. she said again she did not know but she would go and find out. finally she returned with a small gatorade and a straw and scurried off again.  she returned and said the test of his urine was ok  and she wasn't sure what the cause might be for his symptoms.  she then began to throw possibilities and hypotheticals around the room on what she thought might be the cause and what could help.  using  phrases like 'my guess' 'not sure' and ' i think'. after she left the room we waited for another 25 minutes before he got a note for school we had to insist upon and we got the hell out of there. i feel like i let my son down taking him to this hospital.  i think he could of gotten the same if not better treatment somewhere else.  dont believe all the hype and the propaganda.  when it comes to the bottom line any hospital maybe just as good phoenix children's hospital for your child and i will never donate another cent to this organization ever again. we left that day at 4:30pm.",1
"we called ahead for a reservation, and when we got here, they claimed we weren't on the list. another couple in line had the same issue. no apologies offered. food is great, but front of house needs work!",2
"straight up, son, we eat here like every week!   the chorizo tostada is on point!   the number 5 combo is my favorite it comes with the aforementioned chorizo tostada, a taco, and a bomb enchilada.  get the green sauce on your enchilada, my ninja.  the cinnamon iced tea is the boom shpoof and i drink like 4 of them mugs before i leave.  take your posse over and visit with the ultra friendly staff!",5
"on a random tuesday evening i found the following at firefly:

attentive & pleasant servers.
good food.
lively (yet not whooped-up) atmosphere.
most excellent happy hour prices. 
its located off-strip; a mix of locals and visitors.
the soundtrack was thievery corp.
it started to get slammed around 7:00p.m.

five stars for realz cause its pretty close to a ""normal"" urban experience as i've had since relocating to vegas from seattle last oct.",5
always on time and great job with cleaning and alterations.  i am part of their platinum service could not be happier.,5
"the food, cocktails and service here is consistently outstanding.

it's in a very unassuming location, but don't let that make an impression on the skills of the bartenders, servers, and cooks\/chefs at this restaurant. the food, cocktails, and service are consistently phenomenal. my wife and i have never had a bad meal here.

we would like to give special recognition to the young lady who served us on the evening of friday, july 28, 2017. she had to deal with an obnoxious couple who were dining next to us and was still able to deliver a wonderful night of service to us. i admired her ability to patiently deal with this awful couple and we appreciate the wonderful service you gave us!

i would suggest this restaurant to anyone who has not yet tried it!",5
was like an up-scale ziggy's. food was about the same. would not go out of my way to eat there.,2
"for years, we used to make fun of this place because of the name, the sign(s), and the location. we'd drive past and say, ""hey wanna go?"" and chuckle as we drove past.

and then one day, several years later, i went in. 

oh my. for a guy whose favourite joke is ""this falafel is making me feel awful,"" these are the best god damn falafels i've ever eaten in my entire falafel-eating life. the guy that owns the place is hilarious and awesome, and so is his hummus, and so is his damn apple cake that everyone rants about.  last time, i bought a half of an entire cake, a dozen falafels, and probably a quarter litre of hummus, and i don't even have any shame. guess what it was? awesome.

and you know what? i'm going back right now. can't stop salivating. 

don't be like me and wait years to walk in. the value you get at this place is rare to come by.",4
"while living in leslieville, timmie was my go to dog store and groomer. my dog and i were always treated well and we were always happy with the products and service we received. 

timmie is also a great place to get your dogs soccer gear around euro cup and the world cup. i would highly recommend timmie doggie outfitters for all your dogs needs. oh and they carry cat stuff too ;).",5
"hey, it's the capital grill - so you know the food and atmosphere are going to be very high quality - and this one is no different.  excellent food, beautiful inside, nice and quiet (but not too quiet).

i always seem to be coming here for lunch and not dinner - and it is the perfect place for a business lunch: good food, swift service, and you are able to have a conversation without shouting.   very 'classic' interior - yeah, like a dc restaurant inside the beltway where people discuss politics, business and clandestine wars.

there is only one downside - the parking... which is consistently awful ... they almost force you to get valet parking since the rope off most of the nearby parking for valet only - so your choices are to walk far (and be late) or pay for valet.  they are right next door to a similarly high quality maggiano's, so i am not sure they can do much about it. but the parking problem is enough that it warrants special mention.",5
"food was good but the service sucked. our waiter was such a bummer. he literally never cracked a smile and was slow and acted agitated every time we asked for something. i've never had such an unfriendly waiter.

the nachos were amazing but the burger wasn't anything special.",3
"stopped in here for breakfast on a sunday morning. very friendly staff, family-run with great service. brisket benny was delicious & prices were very reasonable for toronto.",4
very nice people behind the counter. excellent service and great coffee. i am part of a wine club that is in the area and the #wineangels told me about this place. excellent place to go if you are in area and want to support small businesses and get a great cup of joe!,5
"there's something ironic about az88. it really is a bit of a paradox. but not neatly so. on one hand, the words that other people have used to imply the vibe of the place are fair. it really is all of those things; assuming, euphuistic, grandiose, inflated, magniloquent, pompous, showy,  and sometimes downright snobbish (thank you thesaurus.com). it's in scottsdale. people dress up to go here. coyotes are always on the prowl. that being said, they have $7.00 sandwiches, people in khaki shorts and t-shirts sitting on plastic chairs outside in the 70 degree phoenix winters, and mediocre service (sometimes downright slow). so, i still can't quite get my head wrapped around this place. one thing i did learn is to avoid the cocktail menu unless you're an american express red member. one night a friend and i ordered a martini each and our bill came to $25. with tip almost $30. thanks but no thanks. so, this place is the yin and the yang, the best of times and the worst of times, the id and the superego. i think that you almost have to go once just to decide if you love it or hate it.",3
"amazing service, extremely reasonable pricing. they are able to get stains out when no one else can. brought in my favorite shirt twice with stains--the first time i went to klinke's first--they charged me more and didn't get out my stain. brought it to right touch and they got it out first try and charged me significantly less. wouldn't go anywhere else for my dry cleaning!!",5
"can i just say: wow. the tsujiri matcha latte and o matcha daifuku are the best i've had in a long time. such rich, real flavour, it's amazing! it is a little pricy but the quality of that drink and daifuku were worth every penny: the daifuku melted in your mouth and there was cream in the middle! :)
however, there's definitely some things on the menu that aren't as good. i'm not a fan of the tsujiri sundae for example: the rice crisp thing in the bottom just tastes like filler or something.

overall amazing! would definitely recommend! :)",4
"i really like the friendly and efficient staff at this location. typically i've never been in line to get a table with the exception of a few times over the last two years. they always have a weekend brunch special menu with some breakfast entree and an included unlimited coffee or tea, which, for me, is a really good deal because i do spend a lot of money on coffee on weekdays.  their breakfast items are not the best i have had, but that isn't to say it's not fair for the price and still yummy. my favourites are the corned beef hash, the egg sunset (their version of eggs benedict). the portions are usually generous, with the exception of a few times where i felt i didn't get as much food in my plate as during a prior visit.",4
"stop. i like this place. i don't want to hear that this place is some generic watered down japanese food restaurant or something.  i don't think this place was made to be authentic.  it's catering to a broader audience or to first timers who want to get their feet wet with some asian food, or people who  just want that quick asian food fix  without the full menu experience  i've had the chicken, beef, pork, and katsu plates. their house dressing for their salad is unique like a sweet vinegerette. their gyoza and shrimp tempura is just like what you'll find in any japanese restaurant.  the food is flavorful and made from scratch and made to order. sizable portions that are satisfyijng to your belly. service is quick and courteous. it's great fast food without the grease and the short order cook with a spatula banging on the bell yelling ""order up!",5
"wow! good, fresh food. we will be back! had spicy tuna sushi, phoenix trio and crab rangoon. each was great!",5
"henderson is just bursting with great breakfast spots, and peg's is the latest option to hit this side of town- and they're solid contenders to be your new favorite! 

came in with bethany e and shared the tamale & egg plate and a featured special, the crabcake omelet. the tamale was the star of that plate, which was served in a huge skillet with eggs, beans, coleslaw, fruit, and hash browns. you could practically feed a family with this! everything was good, but the tamale was great and i'd totally get it again. 

the omelet was bursting with flavor, with the cake in crispy bits rather than one large slice, making it easier to enjoy a bit of everything in each bite- lots of mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, and capers, with a rich hollandaise on top!

in addition to great food, the service was on point with constant refills and smiles. happy to have peg's now at the other end of nevada, looking forward to coming back to try more!",4
"horrible service! this place damaged my car and is refusing to pay for the repairs. jovelle is one of the worst employees i have ever spoke with as well as the cashier. they continue to hang up on me every time i call, even after a jovelle requested to speak with my technician and was advised the diagnosis she is refusing to cover the damage. on top of that my was not even cleaned properly. this place is a joke!",1
"german food is disappointing.  food would not cut it in munich.  overpriced and mass produced.  fun place for beer, entertainment and watching soccer matches.  service is mediocre and they pitch their merchandise.  did i mention beer improves the food?",3
"motel 6 + ikea = sls in vegas
if you are using the bathroom and  your friend is washing her hands be careful getting out  the rolling door will hit you . rooms are smaller than hotels in europe.
tv was crooked on the wall. only one soap to use to shower\/ bathroom.
the pool was closed on sunday and cleo restaurant was closed on monday.
this is not the same sls as la and definitely not vegas standards.",1
"so i lived in the area for a while, and for some reason, never went to nirvana.

i am jacks inflamed sense of idiocracy

the place is perfect for hang over, chilled out, meeting with friends, laughingness good times. 

the place is quite big, and and it's a sit down bar. it's almost like the our old 'green room' on bloor, minus the bitchy asian owner and add a crowd of the same type, but plus 10 - 15 years in age. 

the food is not bad at all, and very cheap. and most of the menu seems pretty healthy which i welcomed. but they still have your bar musts like the nacho's, wings, etc.

music is good, service is good, interior is hippy chill, beer selection on tap not bad. and bottled domestic beer is effing cheap at $3.50

love the character. still don't get why i'd never been here.",4
"i've only been to the deli\/cafe for lunch and i love it! over 20 types of salad, 20+ sandwiches, desserts, and a hot bar. great place to grab and go. nice seating for groups and free wifi. everything i've tried has been delicious and tasted fresh.",5
authentic italian deli in the unlv area. what to expect!- good food served with a slight attitude at a so so price.  had the spaghetti and meat balls which were very tasty but only 2 small meatballs for 9.99 at a hole in the wall in the hood? that was surprising. would still recommend for a long lunch but not a date atmosphere,3
"i agree completely with aaron's statement ""the sales staff here are super friendly, though not all that knowledgeable about what they're selling.  it was quickly apparent to me that i knew more about the car i was buying than they did.""

while our salesman was polite and friendly he could not answer simple questions about the vehicle that someone in his position shouldn't have an issue with. as an example i asked him if the test vehicle had an upgraded stereo system and his answer was ""i don't know... i think so... umm, yeah."" which doesn't inspire much confidence when i should be dealing with an expert in his field. after a little bit of research i found out the sportwagen doesn't even have an option for an upgraded stereo.
 
a prime example is the work up sheet that his mgr. emailed to me later in the day with the wrong transmission on the car and not all the options that i specified. attention to detail is critical when considering making a large purchase and obviously he doesn't feel the same way i do when making this assessment.

due to our experience we chose not to purchase our new car from this dealership and in fact bought ours from ca.",2
"thank you to john at goldies for the most seamless car buying experience ever!!!!  we did something out of the norm for us and purchased a car we only saw pictures of and john's word that we shouldn't worry.  we came from ventura, california to meet him, our car and the great staff at goldies and couldn't be more relieved and absolutely happy!  a few small concerns came up and john once again without hesitation eased our mind and took care of everything!  john you have made the experience of purchasing our dream corvette the best reality ever!!  driving to hot phoenix was soooo worth it.  we would recommend goldies motors to anyone.  

thanks again  scott and summer

 oh and happy holidays",5
"have been to the newly remodeled theater 4 times now, and i would recommend only if you don't mind paying twice for on line tickets and spending far too much time on the phone and email in an attempt to have the duplicate charge reversed (they still have not reversed the charge by the way!) the visit prior, we were charged $6.99 for the first showing instead of the $4.99. had to spend a good 30 minutes at the box office to have that corrected! the staff is friendly and the prices are great if you are charged properly! i recommend buying your tickets at the box office if you do visit because the company clearly has no clue how the on line operates and they do not show both charges going through even though my bank acct clearly shows both! very frustrating and a waste of time to save a few bucks, definitely not worth it. if customer service reads this review, a little professional advice, if a customer has an ongoing issue for 1 month, transfer them to a supervisor!!!!! don't offer to do the same exact thing the last customer service rep promised and failed to do! please get your on line dept together, your customers would greatly appreciate it, assuming we will remain customers! :( i'm doing 1 star for the friendly staff that hopefully gets a raise from all of the over payments myself and other on line customers have more than likely made!!)",1
"i've eaten here numerous times and am still amazed how popular these places are. it must be because they're open 24 hours and late at night it's one of the few places you can get something to eat fast. that's the only reason i eat here.

the good is soso. it fills you up but as far as being flavorful it leaves a lot to be desired.

i'm sure i'll visit again. it serves a purpose.",3

"love this place! they have some great options to mix and match burritos. their food is really fresh. i love the sauces they mix. their prices are fair, about 10-15$ based on what you get. you do get a huge portion though, and its very filling. you get alot of protein for all the dishes. the steak dish we got was basically almost half a box of steak.",5
"every good thing i heard was exceeded. when we have folks from out of town escaping the harsh winters up north, we will definitely bring them here. the food was phenomenal - we had sesame-crusted salmon and the moroccan fried chicken. omg, wish i could cook like that.   appetizer teriyaki meatballs were really good.  chocolate mousse desert - yum.",5
"2nd time there and still love this place!  must go when you're in oakville!

"taros fish is an awesome sushi joint the bf and i found through reviews one day and decided to check out. it's not a restaurant per say but it doesn't lack in great service. you can purchase slabs of fresh sashimi and ask to get it sliced on the spot and eat it right there! there's always a great variety of fish from different than regions as well, say atlantic salmon versus salmon from fish farms.
whenever we are in the area we always make a stop at taro's. i just wish they were open seven days a week. keep up the great work!",5
fantastic service by my hairstylist megan!! she was super amazing kept conversation going ! gave me a new look fixed my damaged hair all at one and met me on her day off at the time that best worked for me! will be back in 6 weeks for a touch up! :),5
"same quality as other chipotles i have eaten at. one of the options at birkdale village to eat quick and get on your way. service was quick. cleanliness of tables could have been a little better. sliced lemons for drinks were a little on the dry side as well, not as fresh as they could have been.",4
"not terrible but not any means special either.  

the greeter was about the only sincere person in the joint who seemed interested in making sure we learned the lay of the land and how the process unfolds.  beyond that, associates were happy to treat folks like they were quickly just herding cattle.  a 'manager type' doing some office work on a table nearby was on her cell phone and occasionally looked up over her glasses at guests, but absolutely no life otherwise from her. an associate stocking drinks lids made folks hang around while he finished stocking vs. letting folks get their lids and be on their way.  

it was black friday lunch time and i was looking forward to a chicken bbq sandwich.  i was denied, they only offer chicken on a bone.  i wanted a light sandwich considering the heavy eats the day before.  despite my fridge holding pounds of turkey, i ended up with a turkey sandwich.  my regret immediately sat in when i realized my only condiments for my sandwich was commercial packaged mayo, cut onions and pickles or bbq sauce. the sides were pre-packaged coleslaw mix swimming in mayo, potatoes swimming in mayo, beans or 'new potatoes' which is steamed red potatoes but then swimming in butter. 

my husband liked the brisket.  any repeat business will be from him for the occasional lunch because i can land mediocre food and service anywhere else.",2
"the best breakfast! omg! the pancakes are enormous!!! we loved the brown sugar banana and the snickers, plus the veggie hash was amazing!! a great finale to our visit to vegas. really cool vibe, and excellent service too! oh...and if you want to start your day off with a cocktail, this is the place! the bloody mary was insane!",5
"unlike other people's reviews, i really loved this place. the wait time wasn't that long and the service was excellent. 

their food was also delicious. we shared the appetizer platter at 5 people. it was 60$ for 6 different appetizers. the salmon tartare tasted great and came in a generous portion. you can also ask for more croutrons. the dessert was awesome and well made. the nutella moelleux was extremely soft and chewy. the drinks during 5-7 are cheap. the place itself was clean. 

would definitely come back.",5

"i'm a regular. if you want a great burger, fries and a beer -- from an enormous selection on tap -- delux is an excellent choice. if you want that with a side of sushi its probably the only place in phoenix. the sushi is excellent and fresh. having it with french fries, a burger and a beer is odd, but very enjoyable. the burgers are consistently excellent. they encourage you to order medium rare with is unusual for a burger joint and shows that they have confidence in their beef. the chinese chicken salad is one of my favorite items on the menu. also, if you want this at 1 am it's the only place around. the bar staff are always up for conversation. in the parking lot you'll see porsches and pickup trucks. at the bar 20 year olds are seated next to 65+ year olds and after a few beers everyone is chatting. it's also a great place for take out.",5
"been here for lunch a few times and ordered online. the mole sauce is very good, i usually get that with chicken. sometimes it can be a little off with the sauce to meat ratio ends up turning into a soup, but for the most part consistently tasty. the service is always good, even when i've gone with big groups the waitresses take orders correctly and are prompt with bringing drinks\/refills\/chips.",4

"my fiance recently went into london gold to pick out an engagement ring.  being the type to change my mind a thousand times, he went at first looking for a sapphire center stone.  he ended up going back and looking at diamonds, and the staff was very helpful.  since we were going to do a custom design, but he still wanted some surprise, they set the stone in a band, and we came back later to have the custom design done.
first, the stone is gorgeous!  my fiance said they were patient, showing him multiple stones, and making sure he was happy with the final choice.  they did well! :)
we went back a few weeks later with pictures of the design we wanted.  the cad artists sent us a design for review.  he was very patient with us, even allowing us to come in and sit with him and ask questions.  he made changes and sent us a new drawing.  we approved!
after a week, we were able to go in and look at a wax model of the ring and now we were even more excited!  after a few more weeks (we were having some stones custom cut) we go the ring and couldn't be happier!  it turned out just beautifully.
the sales people were incredibly helpful throughout the whole process, especially sara who did a great job helping us every step of the way.  we'll definitely be going back when it's time to pick out wedding rings!",5
"a family outing... a rare occasion i would say, but my brother pulled another ""rather spend time with some hoochie than family."" don't want to get into details, but we were fed up from waiting for him to go eat and told him to just forget it. sometimes i wish he would care more about his family than some random girl that he barely even knows. makes me really sad that he treats us like this.. sorry guys.. i know this is a review.

so i took my parents to hikari for ayce. they love sashimi... i love fried food.. i know it's bad, but i like it so.. here's what i ordered:

seaweed salad (2x) - the first one was light, tasty, and fresh.. second time around it was way too salty and overly sauced.

cucumber salad - half moon size cuts, crisp juicy crunch... it was... ok.

salmon skin salad - drowned in real tangy, vinegar dressing... made my tongue numb! there were bits of salmon meat not skin that were hard as a rock, almost like bones... be careful in eating this... you can chip off your tooth if you're not watching your bite. however, there were pieces of salmon skin that were a light bite like potato chips... that was only a few.

fresh oysters - my mother loved this and ate about 8 of them!!! and even had one more for dessert! yikes! i had one but that sucker was huge and i had to really break it down to swallow it. i prefer those thin slimy kinds you just slide in your mouth and swallow... this was like wtheck thick. my parents loved it... me on the other hand passed on ordering more.

tempura combo - i had the whole thing.... the shrimp was ok... carrot, zucchini, onion, mushroom.. were nothing spectacular. the crunchy coating didn't have any flavor to it... disappointed.

baked green mussel - they cut the mussel in half, so you don't eat the whole piece... it was watery, mayonnaise was so sour, and it just tasted off.

dynamite - again mayonnaise was too tangy and too much. i couldn't taste anything, but the sourness. the bites of seafood were hard to chew like leather... not edible and had to take it out of my mouth a few times. don't order it.

kama - my father ate the whole thing... said it was tender and flavorful.

fried rice (shrimp) - i finished the whole dish. it was very delicious and almost ordered a second round, but wanted to try other dishes. good choice if you like fried rice.

hamachi (yellow tail) - my mother enjoyed this very much and ordered it again.

hotate (scallop) - very fresh and a beautiful white coloring... gleaming with perfection. it was satisfying and good!!! probably the only thing i liked besides the fried rice at this place.

ama ebi ( shrimp) - we all ate a few... it was cute and yummy.

tuna roll - had no flavor, looked bad.. almost like a grayish color. my mother only had one and said it was terrible. shoot, it looked terrible. had to hide the other five under another dish. don't order it... you'll thank me.

caterpillar roll - nice presentation, but didn't really ""taste"" the roll. didn't work for me.

miso soup - it was soothing and steamy hot. good start to this meal.

ended with green tea and red bean mochi for dessert ($2), which isn't included in the ayce deal ($27) the dessert was good... i liked the green tea more since it tasted fresh versus the red bean that tasted and looked kinda old.

the iced green tea was refreshing and the servers were very attentive in clearing our plates when we were done. the sushi chefs were all busy with requests and orders, but asked us from time to time if we were okay or wanted anything else. one chef with glasses seem to have a real cocky attitude, but maybe coz my face was all scabbed up and he didn't want to be nice to me... whatever. other than that, i would say it's a ""decent"" place for ayce but it will be one of those this dish was good and that dish was bad. it's not really consistent in having all their food being delicious and well cooked. would i go here again?!?! only if i have to.",3
"great customer service!! my whole family uses dr. arizala's optical service for almost 5 years now. he is always on time and very easy to talk to, answers all my questions. very professional!! we will see him again next year.",5

"been wanting to try this place out because i've heard from several people about how great it was. they were right! 

totally worth the $26 for ayce. you can order sushi as well as tapas. they have a pretty big menu! 

came in with a friend and chose to sit at the bar. the sushi chef benny was amazing! he suggested rolls for us to try & asked us what types of fish we liked & would make up things himself for us to eat. so good!!!  he was also entertaining and fun to talk to which made the whole dining experience much better. the fish was fresh and tasted great. totally recommend the lobster popcorn roll. dessert was also really good! we had the fried green tea ice cream and the banana dream which is fried banana w\/ vanilla ice cream. 

love the way this place is decorated. also impressed that the bathroom was clean since most places in china town aren't lol. 

i think i found my new sushi spot!",5
"great subs... horrible customer service. 

decided to go to my favorite sandwich shop mr. goodcents today. was a rainy day so no other customers were around. walked in and the cashier (the only one to have any customer service skills) was changing the bag to the garbage. there was a woman on the slicer who looked up as we walked in and looked back down, a younger guy who seemed more interested in flirting with the girl next to him at the sandwich station. not one of these people greeted us, smiled...  we felt awkward the entire time. like we were bothering them. when the lady on the slicer was done cutting the bread she handed the top half to the guy next to her and he threw it at the girl he was standing next to. the whole experience was a mess and very disappointing. the only positive was the cashier. who was polite and friendly.  definitely will not be returning to this goodcents.",1
"after great anticipation of the opening of pastabilities, i was quite pleased with the experience i've had there. 

the first time i went, i was welcomed by the hostess, who explained the layout to my group. there are sauce options and pasta-shape options (including slightly more expensive agnolotti). there are also a selection of desserts (the brownies are great!), salads, and garlic bread. 

i've had the vodka smoked salmon with rose, and the spicy italian sausage  - i've also tried the spicy arrabiata, and the cold pasta salad. 

of these options, my favorite was by far the salmon rose, and second favorite the arrabiata. the sausage option was just okay, as the sauce was almost watery (kind of disappointing after the great first experience with the salmon). also, the cheese garlic bread is greasy and heavenly (not for those on a diet...). 

another thing i would have loved to know going in, is that i cannot eat a large. i ate it for lunch and dinner that day. the next time i went i opted for a small, but was still stuffed after finishing it - and my friends with less voracious appetites can only get about half-way through a small. be prepared to take home left-overs!  

what is really great about this place is its charm. i love the decor, and the bench seating. also, the cooks are fantastic! they make great suggestions and all seem to really enjoy working there. 

this is certainly on my list of lunch places for the school year!",4
"best place ever. healthy, delicious, relaxed, fresh, clean place to grab coffee and a bite. the people that work there are amazing-friendly and helpful.  free ice tea refills.  vegetarian options available.",5
fun!  i like this place but i think the hours stink.  since i mostly have time to go in the evening i find myself going to as you wish more often.,4
had a great experience.  the wait staff was very attentive and courteous.  we had the pho and cajun crawfish. it was all excellent!  we were completely satiated and happy. we will definitely be going back again.,5
"agghhhh! it's so frustrating when one person ruins an entire experience but here goes:

i've been to sushi crystal 3 times now and had i written my review the first two times, i would have rated it 5 stars. however, after my last visit, i've had to knock down several stars. here's the story:

first visit: early november. excellent service and amazing food. zero complaints

second visit: early december. same as before. decided that this would be my new go-to ayce sushi place

third visit: this past weekend. i went with 4 other people and we placed our order shortly after being seated. it was a saturday night and the service was very slow despite the restaurant not being at capacity. we realized after the first hour that they did not bring out all our food but had come out to ask us if we were ready to leave. at this point, we mentioned the missing items, and our unhappy server said that he would look into it. no food came. 

so, we did what any normal person would do and placed a second order. our server reacted to this with a pretty bad attitude and was shaking his head. we couldn't figure out the problem but assumed that he thought we were ordering too much food (our first order was barely anything past normal size-wise). from here on onwards the service to our table in particular slowed down immensely. our server also asked us at least once more if we were ready to pay and was displeased when we said no. 

also, after placing this order, the server didn't reset our tablets (you order your food off a tablet btw! super cool) so we could place another order which confirmed our suspicions that he didn't want to bring out any more food. we had to ask different servers and even the manager to unlock the tablet so that we could place orders for ice cream twice.

all in all, despite the food being amazing, we were not able to enjoy our time at sushi crystal due to the bad attitude of our server. i'm really not 100% sure what the problem was till now because if i think back, we truly didn't order that much...

anyhow, with all this being said, i don't want to say that i won't be back because the food is very good. i'd like to think of this as an isolated incident and will try to return once more hoping for the excellent service i had twice before. but for now, 3 stars sushi crystal! :(",3
"update review-after 5 months vladimir came back because the freezer temp was up again. i didn't know it was because the ice machine was totally frozen up. fixed ice maker, gave me tips on what to look for if it the wheels started to come off again, and didn't charge for service call, saying it should have been working. yelp gives us reviews on the good, the not so good and the bad. this guy is truly good. call him.",5
"we used service king to get our mr2 spyder repaired because they were on the ""best of"" list for our insurance company.  wow - we can see why!  this company is awesome!!  the people are incredibly customer friendly and professional and they did an excellent repair job on our car.  we highly recommend this company for any collision repairs.",5
i'm in love with this place the food is amazing the people are friendly and nice. it's also a really clean and happy place. i usually order the chicken nachos man those this are the bomb best nachos i had in my life i will love to go again soon.,5
"i have never had a more unpleasant concert-going experience than the one i and my party was subject to on saturday, october 07 at stage ae. i cannot emphasize strongly enough how unwelcoming and unprofessional we found this venue and its employees and subcontractors from landmark event staffing services of western pennsylvania. my party drove five hours attend this show and visit pittsburgh. ultimately, we were not able to attend the show and my party was verbally abused by the personnel at the show (specifically: pa309 from landmark event staffing services, at the southeast entrance of n shore drive, who refused to give his name). 

for concert-goers interested in attending stage ae, i strongly recommend re-thinking this trip and attending another venue or another show on this tour. the primary concern is with a new bag policy at the venue, which prohibits bags from the venue (which are not clear plastic) that are larger than ""the size of a hand"" (4.5 inches by 6.5 inches). the venue does this in the interest of security (an important objective for any venue). the venue, however, does not have metal detectors and - once passing the bag screen - you will be subject to an extensive pat-down in gender-assigned lines. if you pass security with your possessions in your hands, you may be given a clear plastic bag to carry them in the venue (which, by volume, is much larger than the required limits at the door). none of the exterior guards informed us of this option, which we only learned after the show from friends who were able to attend.

this results in a chaotic experience at the entrances. women are throwing purses into the bushes surround the venues, hoping they will not be lost or stolen. people are separating from their parties, including many who can never attend the show, as they hold bags for their group. if you drove, you can return your bag to the car, but many (ourselves included) chose not to drive. we met a couple at riverfront park (great people), whose first dance at their wedding was to a song by the national (playing saturday, october 07) but who had to listen to the show from the park outside. i understand security guards have an important - and very difficult job - to enforce venue policy and security standards, but we were insulted and verbally abused by pa309 who yelled at the women in our party that ""if you have to have birth control, you should take it in the morning."" 

in addition to being ineffective, the policy (and stage ae and landmark event staffing services who implement it) is discriminatory. if you choose to wear outfits without generous pockets; if you require time-sensitive or on the spot medication for acute conditions; if you need an inhaler, an epi-pen, an insulin pump; if you're nursing and carry a pump; if you're carrying tampons; if you're bringing birth control, you will not be welcome at stage ae and - in our experience - may be subject to verbal abuse by employees of the venue and landmark event staffing services (as we were on october 07, 2017).",1
food was great.  i had the cheeseburger pita and it was just what i was craving.  the pita break was great and the side of pasta salad was light and tasty.  it is super inexpensive too.  i will definitely be back here!,5
"this is a great place to get some regional beers. i'm from out of town and i was hankering to try something from the area. thankfully, i got off the bus near the old fashioned. they have a huge range of beers and some cheap tasting flight options as well. the wait staff is friendly, attentive and has lots of suggestions as well. i would recommend anything by lake louie, especially the warped speed scotch ale. i haven't tried any of the cocktails, but they have a number of options there as well. you can even ""make your own old fashion"" with a range of bitters and whiskeys. 

the food is alright. i would come here more for the drinks.",4
"ahhhhhh, my hopes of good kbbq with all these places popping up, and i walk away like a sad puppy with its tail between his legs. 

maybe i've been spoiled with the variety of options available in los angeles, but this place did not deliver for me. i think there was just one cut of meat that i might go back for, and everything else, i'd rather just hit up an ayce joint because the quality is the same to me. 

the place has a hip vibe, and i sure appreciate it, and they like to cook your meat and are very involved. the service is still super hectic, as they're trying to work out their kinks. i'm not sure if i'd be back. 

we got a combo meal for two and it was one of the most popular set menus. the highlight was the desert! lol",2
"went to richardson's on a double date. it was a saturday night, and thank goodness we made a reservation. the place is pretty small, so it fills up pretty quickly. fyi: reservations are only available for parties of 4+, so we were able to squeak by. :) we were seated within 15 minutes of our reservation time and had a great little booth private-ish booth. i had the red sangria which was delicious. it has pulp (tasted like orange and pineapple?) which is a little unusual for sangria but actually was really good. we also tasted a sample of one of their draft beers (can't remember the name), i believe it was a belgian pale. it seemed like the light equivalent of a guinness. apparently, it's made by monks and was really good. i highly recommend it. 

the food portions are pretty large, so i would definitely suggest sharing. we ordered the chimayo chicken and the bbq chicken pizza. the chimayo chicken is served with a house salad, so between that and the entree, it's more than enough for two people to share. the chimayo chicken was so delicious!! it's stuffed with spinach and sun dried tomatoes, drizzled with a red chili sauce and is served on a tortilla with a cheese\/corn sauce. on the side is a generous helping of asparagus and broccoli, also served with the cheese\/corn sauce, and a chili with a sweet-potato mash tasting concoction on top. 

the bbq chicken pizza was also really good. maybe a little light on sauce, but the onions were delicious and distributed generously.

the service was pretty good, but our server seemed a bit frazzled at being so busy. the chimayo chicken was $24, so a little pricey, but considering it feeds more than one, or feeds one for multiple meals, it's worth the price. i highly recommend this place, and am already planning my next visit.",4
"we chose ph for our vegas hotel because of the location right there center strip, in the middle of all the action. for that location, it's the best quality hotel for the price. the attached mall was great too, could spend a whole day in there without even seeing sunlight (which we did!).",4
"it's official. i am giving up searching for sushi places.  kaizen has been promoted to my #1 sushi spot because what makes a sushi spot golden for me is their selection of rolls (check!) and their appetizers (check!) and their service (check!)

i hope they don't ever get rid of the salad bar.  it makes me feel like i'm being healthy eating there. i love that the server kept giving us jugs and jugs and endless bottomless glasses of iced green tea - a service many other places fail to do. i am so thankful for a kaizen on my side of town so we don't have to go very far when we go home so full, so we can just plop on the couch with a smile on our faces and talk about when we can visit next, not too soon, but not too far, but maybe like once a month would be perfect.  and also, i am especially grateful that their rolls are bite sized, not like monster size, so that we can fit it in our mouths without having it be puffy full and we don't have to cover it with a napkin because other places make their rolls huge.  and its even an added bonus that we can order any rolls half order so we can try more yummy rolls that  they make.  

my only complaint - the music, well one song really.   please stop playing what it is that's playing gangnam style (both guy and girl version) because i lose my appetite for a moment because i absolutely for the life of me i cannot stand that song.",5
"came here for charlotte restaurant week and i must say i am thoroughly disappointed. after eating the steak that's supposedly top quality angus, i went home that night to my surprise with a severely upset stomach (i would be a bit more graphic but i think you get the idea). nonetheless, i emailed the ""corporate"" email provided on their website and never got a reply. two stars is more than generous, only because the service was decent. if your going to claim your food is top quality, make sure that it is inspected properly before it is served to your guests......",2
yea this place is pretty much mcgill sandwich haven. so cheap and so fast. decent sandwich. during finals i'll buy multiple sandwiches and just eat these all day. this is kinda sad.,5
"came here on a cold monday night for a dinner for two. we had a reservation but it wasn't so busy on a monday night that you couldn't walk in without one. 

ordered a 1l mug of sapporo for myself and a matcha au lait for my girlfriend.

for food, we got a recommended shima aji (striped jack) sashimi from japan, which was ok, not my favourite fish, but a nice start. we also had tako wasabi (her favourite) and the salmon natto yukke. i was interested to try the yukke cause i hadn't tried natto before. not sure how much it came through, the taste was more of the garlic and it was the textures that stood out. interesting though. we also had the unagi bibimbap and karaage. these were both good and flavourful but i thought our plate of karaage seemed kind of small compared to our neighbours'.

finally we had a almond tofu as a light dessert, which was nice, light and sweet.

altogether ~$80. service is good, the waiters\/waitresses and atmosphere loud but friendly.",4
"from the atmosphere and the service to the entrees and drinks, this restaurant was the perfect place to celebrate my anniversary. 

our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable on the menu items. i appreciate that he gave us an honest opinion when we asked for suggestions. we had the scallops and pork belly for an appetizer and the lamb and beef tenderloin for dinner. the scallops practically melted in your mouth (and just to note, i don't like seafood!) and the pork belly flavors complemented each other well. my tenderloin was cooked to a perfect medium rare and tasted amazing. i'm not a huge fan of lamb, but my husband devoured his dish and said it was the best tasting lamb he's ever had. my drink of choice was a glass of cabernet and my hubby had a lemon drop martini. their wine list is a little pricey for the common folk like me (my glass of wine was $16 and many of their bottles started around $80), but hey, it was my anniversary. finally, we finished off our meal with their peanut butter pretzel dessert, which was out of this world good. if you're in any way a fan of peanut butter, you should definitely try this dessert!

this was by far one of the best ""special occasion"" dinners i've ever had.  i certainly can't afford to go here every night (if only!), but i'll definitely be back!

quick note: for any girls out there wondering what to wear - i wore jeans and a nice top and my hubby wore jeans with a nice sweater and i didn't feel like we were out of place at all.",5
"just okay. clean and lots of great toys. my only problem is we have tried it three times in the past 6 months, all three times my son has had toys ripped out of his hands, run over with a lawn mower and one little boy attempted to pull him out of a push car by grabbing his head and pulling. i know all kids do this as some point, even mine, but i like to think that i immediately correct the situation and make sure that my kids apologize and understand that this is unacceptable behavior. the parents that i have seen here, could care less. so yes, i do follow my son around when we are there. won't be going again. just don't agree with the parenting style of the clientele.",3
"remodeled rooms, but still an old casino. the bathrooms are small but it's only my boyfriend and myself so we did not need such a big space. also, you pay for what you get, no complaints. the hallways smell a bit ""interesting."" i think they are trying to mask whatever old smell there previously was, with a new citrus scent, so it's now a hybrid smell, maybe they need disinfectant air spray like lysol. i didn't have to wait too long for valet either like the bigger and nicer casinos. anyways, i come back again for the price.",3
"pricey little nail salon in the mall. $45 for a full set (stiletto shaped with regular polish). other reviews speak of the employees being rude but this wasn't my experience at all. a young lady, megan, did my nails. she was really sweet and, like the other employees, made general conversation while working on my hands. on a sunday afternoon there was a pretty short wait time for service. overall pleased with my nails a not so much for the price.",4
"went here after a wedding reception for a 2nd reception with the guests and bridal party.  we were in a downstairs room with its own bar. very cozy and the staff was helpful.  i don't drink but the staff provided me with free cranberry juice, so i'd say they were accommodating.  seems like a great place to sit around and watch the games.   

its in a good location, was very easy to find and parking was a breeze.",4
"this place is such a gem in montreal! for the price you pay, they definitely deliver on every menu item we tried. lobster mac and cheese, mussels, even the tacos were to die for! everything i tried was better than the last.",5
i chose to call this service because of the outstanding yelp ratings but i must say the dispatcher was short and rude on the phone.  i also needed a taxi (suv) to accommodate a family of 6 to the airport with bags and they cannot offer a service beyond 5 people.,1
"celine dions new show at the caesars is amazing. she is the epitome of a solid performer and her voice is incredible. do not think she hit one bad note. i went on opening night and we were all given beautiful programs on our chairs saying the date and opening night on them. we were told they were ""compliments of celine"". not sure how many artists can receive a standing ovation just for appearing on stage. she genuinely seemed thrilled to back in las vegas which is refreshing after so many interviews of stars not being appreciative of having the residency at the colosseum. ahem* cher\/elton. the show is very different from a new day in that this one is all about the music. it is presented in a very classy and old school hollywood\/las vegas way, there is not one dancer. overall, the show is classy, and beautiful. celine proved that she is definitely the queen of las vegas. .",5
"so yummy!!
we haven't eaten here in a long time and i was so happy we decided to! we had linguini with clam $13 that came with a salad or soup.....so tasty!! the pasta was sauced perfectly! bread was soft and warm! we wanted dessert but were too full to have some.  we will def be back! service was also very good. this place is way better than olive garden or macaroni grill!!!!!",4
"great place, came here tonight to pregame for the night and to get some food. from the road it has a good location, stands by itself with awesome signs that you can see clearly. there is plenty of parking and the outside looks nice.

inside is a rectangle center bar that is pretty big in size, has alot of seating along the walls with booths and chairs. you seat yourself but the servers greet you very quickly. the drink selection is great and the menu has a big variety of food. the prices are pretty awesome, 4$-$20, for appetizers to full meals. they carry craft beers and the normal beers. have great sounding cocktails. 

they have a good music selection and it's not too loud inside. many televisions and casino games to be entertained by, they also have arcade games and 2 pool tables! they have a personal jukebox for the entire place where the customers play the music they want. just download the app. nice atmosphere with cool lighting. they even have a nonsmoking area. they got a cool lounge area with classy seating. the booths are very well made too. 

highly recommend this bar to everyone, tourists and locals. will definitely be coming back here! highly recommended  for a great night out without breaking the wallet!",5
"it seems they listened to all the comments windshield guy was not here to harass. 
they did a very good job inside out on my car. 
i would recommend.",4
when you go ask for a hottie named nicki!  she makes amazing drinks and is seriously so pretty and sweet.... great cool...expected her the bartenders to be hipsters and too cool for school sassy attitudes....i'll so be back!!!,5
"love this place!

the service was just ok.  i know that the later it gets, the earlier a server wants to get out of there.  but honestly, it was 8 pm and our server asked us if we wanted our check like three times.  we were drinking.  our tab was over $70.00.  what the heck.

now the food is surprisingly delicious.  i ordered the chimmichurri (sp?) steak salad. naturally gf.  i love not having to modify!!!  it had nice flavors, was cooked well and was actually filling.  dinner salads are kind of a toss up.  

for a beer place, the wine selection is pretty good.  i kind of wish, the wine was a little cheaper.  it is just wollersheim.

overall, i would definitely recommend this place.

oh! and it is right near the airport!  always better than eating fast food before or after a pick up or drop off.",4
i agree with what others have to say here. the shop is very nice but the owner will try everything to extract money from you. i went there about 4 years ago to become a certified scuba diver. after initially signing in the owner convinced me to buy some gear which till now i haven't used. after the initial few classes he started telling me i should buy my own tank and bcd because my life depends on it. the trick he employs is  that he keeps some really very old almost broken down equipment for training and says that unless you buy his shiny new equipment you will have to get certified in the old equipment. the reason he gives is that if you go to any of the other scuba sites they have this very old equipment and it is better to train in that unless i buy equipment from him. once a person dropped in to class to return a leaking cylinder which that person rented from him. he then started telling me this is why i should buy my own cylinder since the person had to come back from his vacation because of his leaking cylinder and this wouldn't have happened if he had bought and maintained his own tank. to make things worse there was very little training since most of the time he was trying to sell his overpriced equipment. he also tried to sell me a vacation package which he and his girlfriend was going to and told me that other people in the class were also going to(there were really no other people in the class). the vacation was of course overpriced and i felt he was trying to get me to pay for all 3 of us. i very soon cut my losses and left the classes and got certified at another place where the divers told me that this guy had spent time in prison. never go here.,1
"really great food, decor and service. every time we come to rocky river,  we eat here! prices are very reasonable. soups, large salads, sandwiches, and much more! service is exceptional! i highly recommend this restaurant. try it,  you won't be sorry!",5
"waka has leagues all over the valley and i've pretty much played in all of them. each league has it's own character, because it's the people that make the experience. if you show up and don't take the time to talk to people, you probably won't have a good time. that's on you. your teammates are there to have fun.

the social part of waka is where it excels over other league in the area. in addition to having a bar sponsor for the league and player parties through out the season, there are other outings through out the year which put waka over the top.",4
"this place was the highlight of my vegas trip. 
this place is clutch. 
every night after a  night of drinking i would cab it to this spot, have a feast..then walk to my hotel for about 45min. no hangovers...and i'm hangover prone...clutch i tell you.

i'm going to describe the food with one word ""phenomenal""!!!!. 
best al pastor tacos i ever tasted, always loaded with plenty of pineapple slices.

love, love, love this place.",5
witnessed the concession stand operators\/cashiers shorting young patrons the correct return change on food purchased during an elementary school outing.  when confronted we understand the operator\/cashier's attitude was that these kids have plenty of money.  what's the lesson here?  ...don't make this a school outing again.,1
"great massage place!  they managed to get me in for a same day massage.  generally very easy to book massages.  the place is very clean and professional and they seem to really care about their clients.  it's also easy to find and there's plenty of parking.  hours are more limited during the summer, but generally no issues getting an appointment.  i'm a fan!",5
so went to watch the fights good bar but damn the service blows other than the guy bartender that helped us but damn the girl bartenders are a joke everytime one of the other male employees comes around its like watching a bunch of horney teens rubbing on each other ... like get to work ladies fuck your job ain't hard this aint a play grab ass with male employe hour took almost 10 min each time to order a drink due to the grab ass games going on behind the bar ridiculous.. and one of the bartenders actually told me that my chewing tabbacco was horrible and how she didnt want to see it well then moron dont give me a spit cup then ill go back but will never sit at the bar agin,1

"i've ordered takeout from here twice so far and hands-down it is the best thai place we have seen in the north hills in awhile (i was a huge green mango fan before they closed in regent square) i tried both the red curry and pad kee mao dishes, both were great!  reason i gave 4 star is because i was not a fan of the bang bang shrimp (lacked flavor) and i also tasted a vietnamese noodle bowl, bowl was good and cooked well however i did not care for their fish sauce.  i'm looking forward to trying their sushi and other dishes - but so far in comparison to the other thai places in the area (besides nicky's which is a little from me) this gets my vote!",4
"place was fun and cool.  you start  to really get the idea of how much destruction a nuclear bomb does and the science of it a little.  i think it was really well portrayed.  as a somewhat review it's goes into 

1) science of a bomb
2) videos of big famous bombs going off
3) how they decided test sites
4) cold wars and how other countries developed
5) 'merica... fuck yeh.  (theres pretty much just random stuff at the end like 9-11 pictures and random patriotic things that make ya just wanna salute the shit out of something in remembrance)

overall i had a fun and good time learnin.  word for the wise though. skip the area 51 exhibit.  if your like me and probably everyone else, and not an alien conspiracy theorist then it's not that big of a deal.  there's some hokey displays and most of it was stuff like ""this situation happened could it be.... myth or reality?!?!!?!?!?"" i found this exhibit asking me more questions then i was asking it.  things like ""was it a frisbee in the sky or alien ufo?? myth or reality?!?!??!?",4
amazing service! i replaced a savant system with a control4 and interviewed several companies before selecting walt's. matt was extremely knowledgeable and answered all my questions. very happy and would highly recommend them!,5
"*pffffffft*  that's how you spell the sound of a fart.  and that's exactly what i did for 2 days this week, after my trip to arriba.
it's basic mexican fare.  we had a group of about 12 and they were great taking care of us.  i never had to ask for my iced tea to be refilled.  
the food?  we made a list at work ahead of time and ordered it right before we left the office.  i ordered the fish taco dish.  it came with a side of refried beans and rice.  the beans were nasty and then i realized they probably weren't vegetarian, so i only had a bite and put them aside.  the rice was...rice.  the only way it had any flavor was because i had doused it with hot sauce.  
the fish taco?  no flavor!  the fish was grilled, but i could barely taste it.  everything was covered in some sort of white sauce and it was all that flavorful, but still covered up any flavor that *could* be in the fish taco.  i still prefer two hippies.
the service was great, but it was really the only thing memorable.  i doubt i'd go back there.

"wow. this has got to be the best food truck experience i've had in phoenix. as we walked through food truck friday during first fridays, we scoped out our options. we checked with yelp and found this was highly rated. best decision ever. thank goodness yelp warned us that each burrito was enormous because we almost each got our own. we decided to go with the fried catfish and jambalaya burrito and it was soooooo amazing. no lie, they were generous with the catfish and the jambalaya had some awesome sausage too. it came with a side of this amazing creole sauce and i needed more, it was so good. the staff was super friendly and asked for our feedback (which of course we told them it was delicious)!! i was definitely in pain due to fullness even though i shared it with eric, but i just could not stop eating it! can't wait to try other items on the menu but it'll be hard not getting the catfish burrito again!  the burrito was $8 but it was well worth it!",5
"accidentally had brunch here on sunday morning and it was great.  i was going to a near by shop which wasn't open yet and decided to have an espresso which turned into brunch and an americano.  my seat was near the front window which was fab since i was alone and it gave me lots to look at.  i had the omelet special which was sundried tomatos with goat cheese, it came with potatos and greens.  i am one of those people who loves salad with brunch, i can't help it, it just makes me feel good.  all in all the dish was delicious: light fluffy omelet, potatos with herbs and salad with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  the dish wasn't anything you couldn't get at a number of places but it was tastey and the location, decor and the coffee mean i would definitely go back.  speaking of coffee, this place specializes in coffee so i should state that the coffee was spectacular!!",4

"after leaving the opera at what i like to call ""half-time"", due to a dreadful performance and weak cast (save rosina, who although quite talented, could not carry the weight of the show by herself.) my date and i opted for a drink at luxe.  

i had previously expressed my desire to check it out, but had low expectations going in.  i don't know why, there's just something about all the text on the front windows that screams pretentious and i figured a lack of follow-through. 

we walked in and obtained a table in the front window.  the hostess and server were very pleasant.  the place was hoppin' full of people eating, drinking, and enjoying themselves.  the music was cranking.  

having just attended the opera, and on the same night of the rock hall induction, i was looking spectacular, as was my date.  i might attribute my extra-glam look to the special attention i received from the owner, who came to take my drink order and to inquire if i had just come from the rock hall.   i think he was disappointed to find it was the mere l'opera i had just abandoned for his fancy-pants restaurant.  however, he did stop by a few times to check in and make mild conversation, something i noticed he only did with our table and that of the one next to us.

the drink was good.  i opted for a nice spanish champagne (have i mentioned that i love a good, dry champagne?).  my date went for a beer.  i might add that they have two of my fav's on tap!  hello for a place that serves left hand milk stout and rouge dead guy ale on tap!  

perusing the menu was enjoyable.  i found the prices to be reasonable and certain dishes intriguing.  after discussion with my date we both agreed we would be back for more.

it was a surprising and pleasant end to a rocky start... (oh, opera cleveland, when will you step it up?)

stay tuned for an update.

if you stay here you can still use the gym and pool over at the flamingo and you are right on the strip. walking distance to everything!

"i would not recommend dr. pahlevan. this office is shady! you walk in expecting one thing and you walk out with another and an unexpected  bill! not only did i think she was a terrible doctor, she never informed me that we would be getting charged for a ""regular office"" visit instead of a well check appointment which we were there to be seen for! 

i will say, the ladies in the front were very kind and empathetic to my billing concerns.

new to las vegas & this clinic. made ""well check"" appointments for both my husband & i with another doctor there that i had researched & learned about. 

our appointments were a week and a half apart however, but had similar experiences. when we arrived to our appointments we were informed that we are seeing a different doctor (pahlevan) that i know nothing about. 

once in the exam room she went over the medical form we filled out in the lobby. we talked about my thyroid issue that i've had for the last 20 years and the medication i take daily. i asked if she can send in a refill for my prescription. we got our weight and blood pressure taken and asked if we had any concerns. i didn't but, my husband mentioned his back was hurting a week prior to coming in. she offered him a muscle relaxer prescription. she didn't do what i think is the normal ""well check"" exams. we were both in and out in less than 5 minutes. then she sent us to the lab for our routine ""well check"" blood work.  

a month or so later i received invoices for my husband & myself and we are slapped with a ""regular office"" copay of $50 each. 

after calling the billing department several times over a period of several months i decide to go back to the clinic & speak to the manager. i find out we were charged ""regular office"" visits because she prescribed me medicine & my husband was charged because he was prescribed the muscle relaxer since he mentioned his back had been aching. all this because she asked him if he had any other questions or concerns during his well check"" appointment! 

guess when you go to this doctor for your well check visits and she asks you if you have any questions or concerns you better not have any or she'll change the billing code on you & slap with you a copay!",1

"**price**
       - $22.00 brunch mon-fri 8am-2pm
       - $29.00 weekend brunch sat-sun 8am-3pm
       - $35.00 dinner 5pm-9pm
**thoughts**
       - crab legs (dinner only) - warm crab legs next to the prime rib. a bit dry since they're just sitting in a pile.
       - shrimp - there were cocktail shrimps in mini cups (2 per). however, this also made the shrimps rather dry. it was amusing to see some people grabbing 8 little cups and loading up their plates.
       - carving meats - they have prime rib, huge beef ribs, and bone marrow. first time i ever had bone marrow. it was interesting. everything else, it wasn't bad nor was it great.
       - mini pots - a good portion of their buffet selection is served in mini pots or mini frier trays. while the presentation is unique, this also makes them a little dry and not as hot as it should be.
       - atypical - they have unique foods like ""cavetelli with roasted chicken and sun-dried tomatoes(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/k7lwdnuhcbcnevi0nhgewg?select=xir7vw2pipy9vyys9stbiw)"" and ""asiago stuffed gnocchi with asparagus and tomato butter(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/k7lwdnuhcbcnevi0nhgewg?select=vbe5zidz4uameymfhqkmdq)."" instead of just plain rice, they have ""wild rice with figs, cranberries, and smoked almonds.""
       - tastiness - though their foods were definitely different, the yummy factor just wasn't hitting it for me. i was disappointed the taste did not live up to the aristocratic names.
**recommendations**
       - i'd recommend this place if you're looking for an interesting experience. however, if it's taste you're after, i'd go elsewhere.",3
"i love coming here on a brew-tiful day!

boxcar social has now become my #1 place to work, hang out, meet friends, or even just admire the beautiful (i mean brew-tiful) view of harbourfront! 
the ambience of the place is perfect and transitions seamlessly through the evening from a chill bar to one that is full of energy and bustling with people moving in and about!

during the day, it's a perfect place to work, kick back with some good tea or coffee and watch the ducks fly in to swim on the pond in front. during the evening, it's a wonderful place to relax with some friends over a couple drinks and catch up on the day's\/week's happenings
the patio is accessible (although the inconvenience of the ramp is slightly off putting) but the marvellous view tends to make up for any ill will. 

moving on to the actual menu, the drinks are reasonably priced (half bottle wine on tuesdays!!!) and the food is actually fairly delicious. 

i would recommend the peach blossom tea with it's scented aroma and it'll leave you in a very relaxed state. combined with the patatas bravas, which has a sour taste but very delicately made and the potatoes crispy, it's a good light bite to get you through the day!
other recommendations also include the smoked salmon and the seared tuna (only available after 6pm at the harbourfront location, aren't you lucky?!)
the staff are friendly, nice and not to mention, extremely accommodating and incredibly patient (a virtue i highly admire in any restaurant staff!)
i love this place too much (not to mention come here to work and chill) to give it anything less than a 5 star review
ps great date spot!",5
"this is not the aladdin's chain that you see everywhere. i am giving it 5 stars for 2 reasons. their hummus and nan. wow. i love hummus and have had it many places as well as making my own. their regular and garlic hummus' are by far the best i've ever had. their ""nan"", a type of pita, is the best as well. i recommend putting the nan in the microwave for about 20 seconds before eating it. the best part is the price. it is so cheap! definitely try it out!",5
this place is so cute ! they have a huge beer menu ! we ordered a rueben and pilgrim pasty. both were good and super filling. would recommend others to come here !,4
"i've been here many times however, the last time i went i did not have a good experience. i have a severe nut allergy and told the lady working at the cashier. she said ""i should be fine"" and that my order won't come into contact with nuts. i ordered the affogato (vanilla soft serve with espresso) since its the safest thing on the menu. as i was eating my ice cream, i bit into what seemed to be a nut and i immediately spit it out. all i can say is that i'm extremely lucky i didn't get an allergic reaction. if there was any chance of cross contamination, the lady should have said so instead of assuring me that my order was completely safe.

aside from that, the ice cream was great but they need to be more careful and take allergies much more seriously.",3
"big fun, great staff, i was very nervous driving a bulldozer, and they couldn't have been better. the exercise starts slowly to let you acclimate. after about 15minutes they give you freedom to work at your own pace. one ""instructor"" for every 2 people driving, constant radio contact, mad me feel safe, moving a lot of earth.",5
"wow!!!!! very simply put, wow!
my friend and i were in the downtown area looking for a place to eat and came across this pleasant gem. 
the minute we walked in we were greeted with smile after smile.
we sat at the bar with gabe who recommended a delicious signature cocktail. (we ordered a second round it was that good)
we had a few questions on menu items and all staff members were extremely helpful. 
we decided on the chicken artichoke bruschetta to start followed by the diavolo pizza. 
lets just say my taste buds threw a party equivalent to the times square ball drop.
i have nothing but great things to say.
great atmosphere, service and food!
there are not enough stars to equate the amazing experience we have time after time.",5
"car wash? more like water with an ounce of soap per ten gallons of water. out here for work to wash my 2014 hyundai genisis. i just purchased the quick 5.99 car asked the guy to spray it down as it is a dark car and he said ""yea! not on the $5.99 wash"" didn't know i had to spend a certain amount to prevent your car wash from scratching the paint on my car. 

i wouldn't spend more than a penny on this car wash. completely rude. probably mad his life is running a car wash. 

i will be contacting the office that my receipt says change due and they did not return my change. it's petty, i know but after the icing on cake was that i did not spend enough to get a pre-rinse. this company will see that even shell car washes pre-rinse no matter what you spend!

this place is terrible. update: after reading the poor response below i would like to say that ""you need to spend more"" ""our car wash doesn't scratch cars"" 
i would like to say your mentality is that of a college kid owning a lemonade stand. secondly, if i have a dusty dirty car, and your brushes, which look as if they are a polyester type fabric and you simply spray soap on the vehicle and keep water moving. the dirt and grime do not stick to the polyester brushes that your 1980's car wash has. 
as far as with any business, i've spent $6 at cobblestone many times and always get an air freshener, wet towel, and the front just spritzed with water. you are a joke. i am going to have my car detailed then i will be by your wash. both with before and after photos. i'm pretty sure i'll be able to show you the scratches that your car wash leaves. keep up the terrible work and trying to expand your lemonade stand with customer service like that! you have to be the worst. i'll be writing and filing a lengthy report with the bbb after your response. good luck",1
"excellent food, service and what wonderful flavors. i had the curry ramen bowl and spiced it up and wow highly recommended. we will be back for more.",5
"first impression - a sexy, intimate vibe. cordial service. absolutely delicious food. we tried one of everything on the short (but not lacking) menu. my fave is the cheese fondue, which is a must-order. free wine served in a baby bottle adds just enough kink to make your meal completely unique and fun!  visit the outdoor bar in the back just for drinks too!",5
"love the atmosphere there, almost nightclub like. great drink specials: sunday 15 bucks to get in but $1 drinks ahhhhhh.. lol ... lots and lots of men, not the most eligible men but some are cute...",3
this is the only store in north america and i must say it's very impressive:) the pricing is expensive so make sure it's what your looking for. the staff are all very friendly,5
"me and my wife have been going here since it opened and have had nothing but good service and good food untill tonight.  we ordered the same rolls we allways get cruch roll and  champ roll. when we got home we had our crunch roll but there was a different roll with it no big deal we call the restaurant only to be told there must have been a miscommunication and they would not do anything about it unless we wanted to order a new roll. which would not be happening at $12 per roll, see i am 100% sure we ordered the right thing simply because we dont know even the names of any of the other rolls. they should have honored the mistake they made and replaced the roll. we will not be going back.",1
"abc has become a weekly stop. we came after watching kitchen nightmares because although i am ashes to admit it our curiosity got the best of us. what we found was a pair of passionate owners who put their heart and soul into their restaurant and they do an amazing job. the food is fantastic, the ambiance is great and the desserts are to die for! amy is a baking genius. her candy bar tart is a toffee chocolaty piece of heaven in a bite. sammy is super friendly and courteous and has welcomed us like long lost friends since our first visit. we fell in love with this place and sammi and amy - it is our new favorite place!",5
poor selection and horrible customer service would not recommend this  lousy business.,1
"stayed here for a weekend, and it's bad enough to make me write a review. horrible experience getting seated at the restaurant, most unorganized seating arrangement. without going into too much detail, we had a party of 6 waiting to be seated and we were asked to form a new line after being next. i complained to the waitress ""shay"", and her only response was that she wasn't referring to our party after having us wait in a new line again. they had several open tables, but not enough coordinated staff to sit us.

hotel rooms were subpar, ac unit kept turning off every couple hours. maintenance came in the first night to fix, it was just a broken switch under the unit. 2nd time we called for maintenance they never showed up. hot weekend in july at a vegas hotel without ac is not a good situation.",1
"3 days in a row for breakfast at mon ami gabi. i'm a big fan of their beef hash & egg benedict. the food was great, huge portion. also, it was very nice sitting at the patio, sipping mimosa, and enjoying the view of bellagio & vegas in the morning. romantic & great food, that's all i can say :)",5
"i love old-fashioned comfort food so when a mid-april surprise snowfall hit yesterday, i decided i needed my fix. given i was in the neighborhood i figured it was as good a time as any to try out mâche! and i'm very glad i did.

shepherd's pie (or pate chinois in french - can someone please explain to me how shepherd's pie, a traditionally anglo dish made from leftover meat and potatoes and vegetables becomes ""chinese pie"", when the chinese traditionally do not consume potatoes?), like roast beef, fried chicken, roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy is the ultimate in comfort food. there's just something about it that makes you feel warm again. 

i first tried their onion rings, huge, perfectly coated and crispy and very, very filling. i got something like 8 rings but they must have come from giant onions, because i was beginning to wonder if ordering a main was too much.

mâche! has a few versions of shepherd's pie so i decided to try le spicy. it came with a fiery, red thai chilli sticking out of my mashed potatoes so i knew right away i was going to get what i wanted. if you don't like heat, then don't order this.  if on the other hand, you're like me and like a bit of kick to your meals, then by all means, go for it. 

portions are big and quite filling so i was very happy when the waitress let me know that i can also take it to go. she even packed it into a reusable plastic container for me to take home safely without any risk of spillage or leaks which i really appreciated. i'll probably come back to try out their sangria, meatballs, burgers and sandwiches. judging from what other people were noshing on around me, it all looked very good.",4
"hotel is ok. a little out dated but clean and roomy. 
room was great size, overlooking the strip.
cons: could use a deep cleaning ie windows, elevator wall needed a lil work, off the strip.. about 1\/2 mile away. cant walk to and from, direct path that is... so cab it, uber it, or take the free shuttle to the tropicana hotel.

overall, hotel is not bad. for under 150 a night.. free wifi free breakfast its truly a bargain.",3
"never got approached by a single waiter, 30 minutes after being seated. in addition had to inform the staff that there were empty free tables after being put in queue.",1
"totally impressed!! great service, music ad food.  got cookies on the house for being a first timer!  very small, casual and very friendly.",5
"i've been coming to polish for nearly a year. always have a good experience when i come here. my nail technician is kathee and she is phenomenal! ask for her! does an excellent job on my nails every time. very close attention to detail, and that's important to me. lots of polish colors to select from. i live in south charlotte but still drive to huntersville every 2 weeks to get my nails done!",5
"having traveled a lot for work i love the westin... but for vegas it wasn't the best choice. 

pros: if you like the westin... it's pretty consistent, and the service is great. the bed was comfortable per usual, and having wifi included in the resort fee was great.

cons: its about a half mile walk to get to the strip, and there is currently construction along that path, so it can get annoying. since it is not one of the major resorts (paris\/caesars\/etc.) food options are limited and you probably don't want to spend much time gambling at the hotel. 

given all of that, during the time we stayed, it was also priced comparable to saying on the strip (at paris), so not sure why you would deal with the inconvenience if you weren't doing it for the spg\/westin brand.",3
"the curry in this place is way too spicy, and too hot. the selection is quite small and rather expensive for the price you pay for. the butter chicken was not the red creamy curry i've had in other places, and i suspect that all the curry came fron the same yellow base, lacking the richness. if you just want some cheap indian takeout, come here, but don't expect any authenticity.",2
"the pool is the best thing about our stay at the mirage. you get basically no comps. we bet $200 on sports and were told no comps for sports bets, and we were betting $10 per hand at black jack, which was the limit, and when we gave the pit boss our players card he handed it back and said we only comp if you bet $25 a hand. what a crock. very expensive, felt like they only cater to the high roller crowd.",3
"i'm only giving 4 stars because there's no mac and cheese on the sides menu. 

really great. sauces were great. pork was terrific (i got an amazing black piece in my sandwich), cornbread muffin was really good. beans had a bit too much meat in them for my liking (i don't love fatty pieces in my beans, but that's just me). prices weren't crazy and the portions are perfect.

i'd totally bring friends here.",4
"i absolutely love this barbershop. juan has been getting my hair for over a year and he is a masterful barber who listens to his clients and makes sure he does what they want. furthermore, the other barbers are really nice, friendly, and skilled. the atmosphere is really pleasant and the ownership is committed to making sure their clients are satisfied. the seats are new and comfy, it is clean and inviting, and has a joyous ambiance. i will definitely be coming here for many years to come and suggest you do to.",5
i have been here for breakfast and dinner. it's been a while since i have had breakfast here but i remember it being very good and service being prompt. last time i had dinner here was with a vegetarian friend and i remember them having vegetarian options. they also catered to her requests. i have stopped by a couple times for drinks and desserts too. i remember the bar having a hook on it where you sit to hang your purse which i thought was pretty neat.,5
"in a sea of strip restaurants that are out to rip off tourists, this place is a masterpiece of excellent customer service and incredible food at reasonable prices - a rare gem in las vegas.  as a testament to their quality, they serve between 600 and 900 customers per day - obviously proof of a great business model.

amazing menu items: (not complete list, of course)
1) filet mignon steak, merlot butter
2) ribeye steak. wow
3) chicken liver mousse pate
4) scallop appetizer
5) house white wine

caveat: if you want patio seating, get there early and be ready to wait.  it's totally worth it, though; you get sunset and the bellagio fountain show.  for me and my friends, this is the go-to place for a great meal - at least a dozen trips and counting.",5
gabe is the best stylist he's very knowledgeable ! he listened to me and what i wanted and sense this was my first time at this salon i didn't know what to expect ! i loved the color and cut and i made another appointment with him for 5 weeks,5
"do not call people to notify of changes if you refuse to tell what those changes are. here's a brilliant idea, if you want to speak to the person named on the account, actually ask you that person. considering that i pay for the service, now i'm getting quotes from dish and other services before i keep with this company. also for future reference i'd consider hiring people who do not end their statement on an upward infliction. it was very difficult to distinguish a statement from a question. how is this appropriate business practice?",3
"we had a nice dinner.  i had the carne asada burro,  my husband had the steak piccada and our son had a egg and chorizo burro.  the food was good but the service was a little slow and a bit unattentive.  i think our waiter was both bartender and server so our first details of margs too a while and getting water filled took a bit longer.  the waiter was nice but i think he was overbooked.   thankfully,  it wasn't too busy.  we did also find a different,  very condensed menu, from what we remember on previous visits but there were enough choices for us.",4
"everything was perfect, very friendly. we ordered the big plate serving 4 people include of 4 screws of 3 different kebobs. that was really fresh and delicious. if you r a fan of meditrainian, this place is located right in the middle of tempe, downtown and the food is great!",4
"i have bought two commuter bikes here. one the khs urbans soul. the bike itself was simple, and cheap. worked well.

i also had them order a touring bike for me that was not in stock 'khs tr101'. the service was great. (i feel like the mechanics rushed putting it together but when i raised some issues, the owner went and fixed everything himself.

as for the bike, i biked from seattle to mexico with it and use it every day as my commuter and i haven't even had a flat tire yet...i'm still amazed...",4
good bbq and a fun location. be prepared to wait in line to order if you're coming at a normal meal time. something they have that some fellow canadians may appreciate is kraft mac n cheese! (they also do homemade macaroni and cheese). deducting a star b\/c it's real good but not like... omg good. it's 4 star good.,4
"sonic is decent at best, saddening at worst. their burgers are alright and their various beverages are certainly tasty at times, but do not even bother with their breakfast food. i got the toaster, which is bacon or sausage, egg, and cheese on toast, and i found it incredibly depressing. the toast had the texture of moist bread, the eggs were a rubbery nightmare, and the bacon had no crunch. on top of that, the whole thing tasted like it was made of poster board. all in all, i think that sonic needs to upgrade or overhaul or something, because i don't enjoy bland and poorly prepared food.",2
"us airways is probably the worst airlines i've ever flown on. but i swear they usually offer the cheapest tickets. i put up with the bad customer service, delayed flight times, horrible inflight service, and outdated planes just because of the cheap price of the airline ticket.

what sucks even more is i am a rewards member with them. i have enough to book a one-way flight but they do not allow you to book one way flights with your mileage points. you would have to be charged round-trip.  what's up with that! once i have enough miles to book a round-trip flight i will do so and then hopefully never fly us airways again.

i say only fly us airways is if its the cheapest by far or a last resort.",1
"how in the heck did i not know about this place, especially being as how i am always at postinos?  helloooo....
this place is a combination of delicious food and quirky fun gifts.  i could spend hours in here buying fun trinkets. what a great place for unique gifts. in addition, they have amazing baked good, gelato, pizza, sandwiches.  oh my!!!",5
"if i could give this business negative stars, i would. dan, the business owner was very lax in returning texts and phone calls. pedal power ran a special on groupon for ""admission for two for pedal-powered party bike."" fine print specifically read ""reservation required. limit 1 per person, may buy 2 additional as gifts. valid only monday-friday."" after 2 unsuccessful attempts to schedule our tour, we finally were able to be accommodated  on a ride friday august 14 at 10pm; however, when we arrived the business owner pulled a bait and switch and insisted we pay extra money for a weekend ride, though it was a friday as specified in the fine print. upon questioning this extra fee, the business owner refused to read the groupon, became agitated stating that he was the business owner and could do whatever he wanted, refused us service, and advised us to go get our money back from groupon. i would definitely not recommend or deal with this business again. groupon did honor the fine print and refunded our purchase price in full even though it was well past their 3 day return policy period.",1
"so glad this place opened up by our house.  never disappointed and we leave satisfied, full, and always happy.  a must visit spot if you are looking for amazing burgers.",5
love it!foods are great. here at vegas for my daughter volleyball tournament's...omg will be here for  valentine to. awesome! :),3
"i love cost plus and i always have. this store in particular had good inventory and staff and i always enjoy my shopping excursions here.

i love browsing the shelves and i never feel rushed when i'm here. bonus points for their candy and beer selections.",5
"i love the decor in here. huge windows and bar seats for people-watching, comfy chairs and low tables for relaxing. i'd like to sit and enjoy a coffee for a long time, but it's hard when the servings are so small for the price. good coffee, though. i suspect this place is better as a bodum and beans source rather than a cafe.",3
"came here for brunch last sunday with a friend at around 1pm.  waited 15 minutes for a table at the bar area where we were able to enjoy cappucinos.  tthere is no seating area so its a bit awkward standing around.

ordered the uova rossa ($13)and uova strapazzate ($14).  both were good egg dishes although i preferred the strapazzate better.  the uova rossa was a thin layer of egg in a skillet.  a bit of a dinky dish compared to the other one.  the toast that came with it was super hard, to the point where it scraped the roof of my mouth and i had to stop.

waitress was ok, a bit absent but it was a busy sunday.  the host or manager was great though, super friendly.  

restaurant itself is a bit unassuming from the outside (base of a condo building) but the inside is lovely, open kitchen and rows and rows of wine bottles on display.  tables are all high tops with tall stools.  short girls need to be careful when they get on and off (just a tip!).

a bit disappointed with the food for brunch, but with all of the good reviews, i'll most likely come back and try out their regular menu.",3
"this place seems to be a valley staple, so i had to try it despite some poor reviews. my experience was pretty good. ordered two sandwich combos at $9.89 each. usually don't comment on beverages, but the rare presence of big red in the soda machine was one i took advantage of right off the bat. moving on to the side dishes, the macaroni and cheese was just average, a bit gummy, but the potato salad had large chunks of potatoes and a nice relishy taste. ok, now onto the main courses. the chopped chicken is just that - 95% white meat chopped onto a bun. so, in this case the bbq sauce better be good or else it will be one dry sandwich and luckily this sauce was tasty, kind of a thicker red vinegar style, but still a good taste and it gets soaked up fast. the brisket was another huge sandwich, almost needing a knife and fork as meat spills everywhere (a good thing). this was shredded or chopped style brisket and i even found a few burnt ends buried amongst the meat. hardly any fat and once again and that sauce made an appearance and ""completed"" the brisket very nicely. place was pretty empty at 6:30pm on a weekday, just the way i like it.",4
"oh my goodness.  i haven't even met these folks in person yet and i highly, highly recommend them!  i contacted aeschbach because my husband and i are considering the purchase of an older vehicle and want to have a thorough pre-purchase inspection done first.  aeschbach has an entire page on their website devoted to this process, so i contacted them to make an appointment.  well, we just had to cancel for the second time in three days due to delays at the dealership.  joe has been incredibly patient and flexible in working with me to try and coordinate this process, and also given me some excellent advice along the way.  this is some of the best customer service i have ever seen and i am not even their customer yet.  highly, highly, highly recommend.",5

"vegan chef mayra completed a demo at my after-school-club for my students. not only did she prepare fresh, organic, and fabulous food (smoothies, vegan potato salad, fruit dishes...), she also educated the students about nutrition and the benefits of cruelty-free cuisine.  chef mayra is passionate about her craft and is very professional. above all, she kept the students engaged. the pupils enjoyed both her food and her energy!",5
i've been going here on a semi-regular basis for over 12 years. the place continues to get better and better. i really enjoy watching football and other sports on their 25+ tvs. the covered patio is a great addition. the service is good and they usually have food and beer specials. the only downside is that parking can be hard to find sometimes... usually on weekends.,4
"das essen ist guter durchschnitt und daher das preis-leistungsverhältnis in ordnung. die bedienung ist unaufmerksam. der salat als zwischengang wird am ende der hauptspeise serviert und das obwohl lediglich 3 tische an diesem abend belegt waren. die möglichkeit der kartenzahlung funktioniert schon seit monaten nachhaltig nicht. hat man kein bargeld dabei, dann geht man besser erst über die bank. die wartezeiten zwischen den einzelnen gängen waren auch bei der unterdurchschnittlichen frequentierung viel zu lang. leider machen wir nun seit mehreren monaten immer wieder die gleichen erfahrungen  wir werden dort nicht mehr hingehen.",1
we just popped in for an order of samosas to go. we were very pleased. going back to try other dishes. nice guy behind the counter. the desserts look yummy! will have to try them too!,4
"if you appreciate kindness and respect for others please do not dine here.  i would give no stars if i could. very dissapointed in the service.  i have eaten at this restaurant many times and do not think i will be coming back nor will i recommend this restaurant to anyone. las vegas has many great places to eat so this restuarant should consider service a priority if it wants to remain in business.  the staff is rude, inconsiderate, slow and believes that because their food is good the service does not need to be.  i rarely take the time to write reviews but when i do its because others need to know important-good or bad things about the places they choose to spend their money at.",1
"i heard a lot of very good things about paymon's, so of course i wanted to love it.

we head there for lunch after work and are seated in the dining area, not the hookah area. 

i will say, having fresh athen's fries is a must with their special sauce. they are definitely special.

i had hot green tea with honey and it was delicious :] served in a pot.

aside from athen's fries we had calamari for an appetizer which was the fried variety-just how i like! and a big serving for the price of about $10.

i had the greek pie.. i forgot the name but the menu read that it had a baked béchamel sauce on top.

overall it was forgettable. it was served with a side of veggies. pretty much tasted like a soup.

someone got the meat kabob gyro which was said to be very good.

and for dessert we shared an unimpressive baklava.

had take out a couple of weeks later from here and had the chicken marsala and also had a bite of chicken parmasen.

helped keep my rating to a 3.

our server was great but it ends with the food which was meh. 

big complaint is the small tables. sooo annoying when the plates are so big.",3
"pretty much walked in, went thru the line and walked out. that place was gross, smelled like vomit and was extremely unsanitary. i knew i'd most likely get food poisoning if we stayed. 

i've worked in the food industry and i've been to other mongolian places but this was plain nasty. it was a salmonella nightmare.

they were out of chicken so the girl washing dishes right by it went to get more. same plastic gloves from the washing, touching door handles, etc and they were so used up they were falling off her hands. then she takes the tongs from the chicken vat, puts them on the countertop, uses her hands to smooth out the new chicken in the vat then with her slimy gloves, covered in raw chicken picks up the tongs and puts them back in the vat. the tongs were disgusting. we all used them and got raw chicken all over our hands. they were out of most things, nothing looked like it was refrigerated or maintained. the items are three deep and you need loooong arms so they probably get all kinds of debris in the open containers from ppl having to bend and stretch to reach in. nothing on their side was covered with a sneeze guard or anything. 

it was sunday night around 6 pm. place was pretty empty but the hostess still put our party of two right in the middle of a large group of people. 

i know people love this place and have enjoyed many meals here without incidence but i was not going to take that chance. it takes a lot for me to get grossed out by a restaurant. this is my first and probably only review. this place needs an intervention!


i've eaten tacos from roadside stands in mexico and have never been grossed out like this. spillage everywhere u looked. dirty floors, tables, etc.

yuck!",1
"went in for our 2nd visit, more people working, fast service, much better this time around!",5
amazing place for ayce bbq. it's new and was pleasantly surprised. the staff did well accommodating us to make sure we knew what we were doing when cooking our own meat. mizzo and blake were very helpful and will for sure be back.,5
"ahhhhhhmazing!! my first time here and it was so delish. their homemade potato chips were so crunchy and flavorful. the haystack onion appetizer was big enough to keep a large party busy until the main course arrives. i will definitely be back here, customer service was top notch as well. gotta love walking into a bbq place and being greeted with friendly staff and the carnivorous smell of slow cooking barbecue.",5
"as usual, my yelper family has not let me down. eco-tint was a dream to work with, friendly, cost effective for a great product, and efficient. 

their tint comes with a lifetime warranty which is always a great piece of mind to have.

i highly recommend throwing eco-tint your business of you are in the market for window tinting.",5
"thanks to christie o., i found a very specific type of shoe here so i wouldn't have to order them online and also have the opportunity to try them on first.  i shouldn't be surprised that there's a store like this in sin city.  let's just say the selection is eclectic and fits right in with our town.  even the sign out front says that the shoes are exotic. hint:  there's a pole next to the register, and, no, i'm not exotic or a dancer, but you don't need to be to shop here. this store is larger than i thought it would be and there are tons of shoes, sandals, and boots, some with heels higher than i've ever seen; i'm in awe of women who can wear those without breaking their necks.  i had called the store earlier in the day to confirm that they indeed carried the shoe that i needed in my size and when i arrived later to try them on, the gentleman was very helpful and courteous.  check red shoes out for a selection of shoes you won't find at the mall or your everyday shoe store.",4
"like an episode of seinfeld - only 50x more expensive than the diner.

we went for happy hour... four of us.  i believe it was 5-7pm?  anyway, the selection consisted of kobe chili cheese fries, lettuce cups, buffalo style wings, and a few other things.  roughly $8-9 each.  i couldn't imagine paying double for these.  of course, sin city is the most expensive place in the us to eat, now.  regardless, we were seated at a very low-top table next to the casino floor which we liked.

now, have you seen the episode of seinfeld where elaine threatens the diner owner for all of his waitresses being ""similar""?  yeah, same concept here.  all looked to be eastern european with black hair, tanned, and smokin' hot bodies.  not that i'm complaining, but pretty odd.  top that all off with the personality of a troll.  i'm sure it was due to the fact that we were there for a drink or two and apps, but if you want a tip, then do your damn job.  we waited about 10 minutes after our drinks came just to see a menu.  finally ordered.  two guys got the fries and wings, and i got the fries and lettuce cups.  their food came out first, and she brought me the wrong french fry item.  i sent them back since i didn't want to pay $15 for some steak fries and some orange looking goo.  by the time they attempted to bring us three orders of lettuce cups (we ordered one), most everyone was done with their meal.  

the 4th in our party actually ordered a non-happy hour item:  mini lobster tacos.  mini is such an overstatement with regards to these.  i think micro is more suitable.  anyway, we're talking $5 a bite.  they were literally the size of my thumb, and he got 4 on his order.  livid sums up how he felt after this.

anywway, is the food good?  yes, what we ordered was good.  was it worth even coming for happy hour or for the shit service we got?  not even close.  save your time and money and put some money on the over at the sports book.",2
"the cupcakes are the best item they sell. i agree with others that stated the service is not great except for one friendly girl. daphne usually looks pissed off or overwhelmed. for proclaiming to be a southern bakery it lacks all of the southern charm you would expect. only the cupcakes keep bringing me back, not the service.",3
"i am not usually a hot dog eater.  but.. if it is a top of the line or a polish dog i am in.  this is my second trip to buldogis.  yes  the chill dog is amazing you need a fork! (and that is good) i just moved from rancho bernardo ca and the hot new place  there for hot dogs had a chili dog that was vegetarian no meat available.  the family that owns it claims everything is authentic.
the east coast dog is great.  i lived in jersey for a while.  i can't identify what in it  is east coast but loved it.  
yes we all know many people swear by costco hot dogs.  i don't even discuss costco hot dogs with costco fans.
dollar per dollar this is the best.  and the service is amazing.  both times i have been there i can't say enough about the service.  and they love dogs!  my german german shepherd was spoiled this time.
we are going back!",4
"at this price point, this place is as good as it gets. i've had the pork tacos and the french toast. they don't skimp out on their portion sizes, and both dishes were very tasty and satisfying. 

the tacos were well seasoned, and tasted quite good for a place that doesn't exactly seem like a place that specializes in tacos. in fact, this may be some of the best pulled pork i've ever had. i'm no pulled pork aficionado, but i do get it quite frequently, and this ranks at the top of the list. 

the french toast was very well done. it was made with a baguette which is something that i don't see very often, and it worked very well. it was crisp, and had the perfect amount of egg, cinnamon and sugar. i would definitely get this again. 

the coffee and desserts are also great. as an added plus, these guys have some of the best eggs in the city.

one of the owners (not sure what his name is), is a very friendly gentleman that has shown on more than one occasion he puts always puts his customers first. the first time was when i went for a sit down meal, ordered a coffee to go, and a few blocks later accidentally dropped the coffee on the street. i came back to get another one because i was enjoying it so much. upon returning, fully expecting to pay for another one, he gave me another cup without charging me for it. business owners take note: this didn't cost him very much to do, but the gesture was genuine, and it goes a long way towards a customer service experience which only makes me want to keep coming back.

the second occasion was when my girlfriend ordered a breakfast wrap with bacon. when we got it, the bacon was chopped up and hidden within the wrap. so, before biting into it, she thought there wasn't any bacon because she couldn't see any. she told the owner who looked at it, and gave her a side of bacon, obviously at no charge. once my girlfriend started eating the wrap, she realized that there was in fact bacon, and once she finished her meal, feeling rather guilty, went up to pay for the side of bacon. the owner laughed and told her that he knew it was in there, but didn't want to dispute it. also, because she was honest about it, he didn't charge her for the extra side of bacon. what a stand-up guy!

another nice touch is when we bought some eggs and he told us about the farm from which the eggs came, and about the chickens who laid them. you could tell he was doing this because he genuinely cared and was excited to tell us about the process, and not because he was cashing in on the eat local trend in toronto.

i've only been here twice, and because of the quality of the food, and the a+ customer experience, this has quickly become one of my favourite places to go in the city. i anticipate coming back here frequently.",5
"convenient location and easy to order from, just point to what you want to grab it to-go or get a meal here.

i primarily came here to try their halo halo special to see if it was anything similar to halo halo i get from filipino shops like goldilocks, red ribbon or jollibee. unfortunately, they were out and only had the regular with vanilla ice cream.

they also didn't have sinigang on the day i visited and only left with a small take out of dinuguan which is a delicious pork blood stew that has a very similar aroma to that of duck and tastes equally as delicious with that graininess that blood has. simply delicious with white rice.

as with most of the filipino restaurants back home in santa clara area of california, food prices are a bit steep for what they are. it remains true even here, i got a small container of food and a halo-halo for $11.

nonetheless, i'll be back to try more of their food when i miss my lola's (grandma) or mom's cooking. crossing my fingers to get my hands on some turon and to try their halo halo special.",4
i am giving it 3 stars just on customer service. i came in to get my foot tattoo touched up and add more. meg did a great job at what i wanted.. but she was just very odd.. rude.. distant. and the guy that was working behind the desk was rude. someone called as me and a couple other people were standing at the desk.. he answered.. the ppl on the phone asked how much is the hourly rate. he told them and then as soon as he hung up... the guys goes.. i hate fu*^%!g bargain shoppers. you can say what you want but it doesn't look good in front of your paying customers.,3
"this review will be short and to the point. i was a little thirsty after watching a movie at the nearby theater. so this placed looked inviting and i was wrong. walked in and sat down at the bar where there was a total of two other patrons. the female bartender saw me , didn't say anything and stomped her way out to a booth. when she stomped back towards the bar she grabbed a menu and slapped it down in front of me without saying a word. funny thing is, i had already eaten lunch and just wanted a drink. she would have known this is she had f*ckjng asked me!!!! then she then was attempting to make a drink right in front of me and apparently someone had used all the pineapple juice so she slammed that container onto the bar and stomped into the rear of the restaurant. i took this as she wasn't interested in helping me so i left. i will reiterate that i believe yelp should allow zero star reviews or negative reviews just for examples such as this.  i don't think that giving one star can appropriately rate an establishment.",1
"très bonne adresse, le fish&chips est très bon, la poutine est aussi très bonne. seul bémol: les frites mériteraient à être plus croustillantes. serveuse hyper efficace et à l'écoute",4
"went here to save money but paid a high price. eyeglass selection was limited, much of the stock seemed old and pricing was higher than expected. my prior glasses had lasted for six years. the ones purchased here were just over one year old when the left hinge became loose. took them in to have the hinge repaired. a guy took them to the back and a different guy came out with the left temple completely separated from the glasses. he said they did not guarantee glasses for more than a year and no longer had the frames. to his credit he did find frames that the existing lenses could go into, and did give a discount on the new frames, and tried to make the best of a bad situation. the new frames met an immediate need to have glasses but were not acceptable for long term use. i ended up going elsewhere for another pair of glasses that i expect will last a lot longer than one year.",2
"a coupon we received in the mail was what originally brought us to this new pizza spot in centennial hills, but their taste and prices will make sure we return. 

if you haven't been here before, blaze is almost like a subway or port of subs for pizza. while they have a preset menu, you can build your own pizza at more of a flat rate. that's nice in comparison to other places that tend to nickel and dime customers for each topping. the original crust is thin but fire grilled, and the pizza comes out fast. the crust has a very subtle but pleasant smoky note due to the fire. it isn't overwhelming though, so don't be afraid! 

what i liked about this spot was that they are upfront and open about nutrition. the menu shows the calories for their set menu items, and their website has a nutrition calculator for build-your-own pizzas. in addition to that each topping label also has its calories listed. you can choose how healthy or indulgent you want your pizza to be. their selection of toppings, cheeses, and sauces is nice and expansive. some choices were rather unique that you don't typically see, such as sautéed onions in addition to normal red onion or a spicy red sauce or a garlic pesto sauce. since it was our first time here, we didn't experiment too much.

we went with a half-and-half pizza. my half was turkey meatball, mushrooms, sautéed onions, olives, bell peppers, and original red sauce. my husband's was more of a meat lovers with sausage, pepperoni, bacon, and mushrooms with red sauce. the turkey meatballs are actually really good. 

while the prices are fitting, i think some might consider the size of the pizza a bit small in comparison to some more commercial pizza joints. a part of this is due to their niche. they promise fast, fresh pizza from the moment it's built to the moment it hits your table. the larger the pizza, the longer it takes to bake. the pizzas are cut into six slices, but it is filling. 

i'd really recommend you try this place out. it's a new spot, but the customer service is awesome. jesse was funny and personable while helping us with our toppings. he even did a little ""salt bae"" performance for us while sprinkling on the bacon. he was so great. they also have some unique drink selections to go with the usual coke or dr. pepper, like prickly pear agua fresca. they also had a soda brand at the fountains i wasn't familiar with called blue sky for root beer, orange soda, and i think a cherry cola. 

if you're looking for variety and affordability, this is the place to go.",4
"the truth is freaky chemicals are added to fortified the ""healthy pizza"" 

i have a problem with no freaky chemicals are added as the website says but the truth is they do add probiotics to the crust.

we've recently tried the thin crust pizzas and found the crust flavorless sort of like a matzoh cracker but sort of like a tortilla with a burnt edge.

the sauce is almost flavorless , how do you take out flavor from tomatoes? i don't know? i threw my own seasonings on to make it taste better.

mozzarella cheese that is lightly topping the pizza is almost flavorless.

i think this is extremely expensive considering you only get a (basically) 10in tortilla for $7.50 with almost nothing on it if you order one topping. this pizza wasn't filling one bit either for the first time in my life i ate a whole pizza. (i normally only eat one or two slices maybe three if i am pigging and the pieces are small)

we are not fans and my husband had high anger issues after trying this pizza he kept screaming to me to only give one star but i think maybe it deserves two stars?  only because it isn't as bad as others i've tried near here , at best i think this is only suitable for appetizers when you are having guest if you can't cook.

also only take out or delivery no sit in dining",2
"we were at b&b on may 20. we had pre theater reservations. we were seated & were greeted by the most obnoxious waiter, anthony. we were told we could not have half the items on the menu since it took a while to prepare. we had 1 1\/2 hrs before we need to leave. i was very disappointed with anthony's service, because of his attitude i did not enjoy my meal at this restaurant.  i love carnevino. so we thought we will try batali's other restaurant. i highly discourage my friends from going to this one restaurant. the restaurant was not busy at the time so i do not know what was the reason for his bad service.",2
what a great shop. huge selection of quality food and treats and all your other dog and cat needs. stopped in for the first time today as i don't live in this part of goodyear and was very impressed with the friendly and knowledgeable staff.,5
"bottom line.. quite possibility the best tacos in las vegas.
however if your from los angeles, and visit taco trucks, you might just be disappointed.  
2 dollars a taco is kinda expensive.  this is their main flaw and why i don't visit this place that offen.",3
"humble pie pizza restaurants.   humble is right, the pizza is very similar to grocery store frozen pizza, their primary competition.  the pizza is below average, small, unoriginal, and has a large price for what you get.  go do something original and provide a great product at a value, $20.00 is not a good value for a 12"" pizza.  maybe not 12"" but we were all left hungry.  you can't feed three people on one pizza.",1
"my parents love this place. they ranted and raved about how great it was so when my mom invited me to go there for a girls night, i was happy to try it out.

the restaurant itself is gorgeous. fake trees covered in lights...the whole nine yards. i hear they have live music on the weekends. the stage was beautiful.

everything was pretty expensive but i don't mind spending $15 on a meal if it's worth it. i ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and a margarita. 

the margarita was alright. nothing too special. definitely not a twelve dollar margarita. as for the food, well it was horrible. my enchilada had cinnamon on it. cinnamon. it didn't say that it would have cinnamon on the menu. i hate cinnamon. i was really polite about it when i mentioned it to the waitress and she said, ""well authentic mexican food usually has cinnamon on the main dishes.""

excuse me? my last name is montoya and i was running around in diapers eating fresh tortillas before this waitress was even born. my family visits mexico multiple times a year and i was raised on homemade mexican food. not once ever has there been cinnamon in it. i wouldn't have been mad about the cinnamon if she hadn't said that. it is not authentic mexican food. i have no idea what she was thinking.

if you like overpriced 'mexican' food that tastes nothing like mexican food and love dessert spices on your enchiladas, then i'd suggest coming here!

stick to the bar for the atmosphere because it's lovely but avoid the food at all costs.",2
love this nail spa very clean and very friendly. they remember my name after one time be there.,5
don't really know where to begin.  i really don't know how in the world this place passes health inspection.  it is filthy...sadly there are no other words. it is open to the public to see where the food is prepared so one would think it would be clean .... it is not. i am not sure if there is new ownership that is absolutely no excuse. the food at one time was decent but the truth be told i always had it delivered so i was not aware of the cleanliness of the place or lack there of. i started picking it up and was disgusted thinking ...  am i crazy?  this is ptomaine poisoning waiting to happen. filthy filthy filthy .,1
"super pleased with this place. i was with a friend who recommended eating here. from the outside, i would never think to stop in. i'm so glad we did! the quality and freshness was inherently present. i had a carne asada quesadilla. while it lacked a bit in cheese for a quesadilla, it made up with loaded meat and guacamole. so many places charge extra for guac, but not this place! i can't wait to go back and try more menu items!",5
"#singaporeanfood #malaysianfood #mississauga #yelp

tucked away in the asian end of mississauga where i have a few favorites already, this is the newest one that makes it to my list of. i like that it's family owned and serves something different - i haven't exactly found any place in mississauga that serves singaporean or malaysian cuisine. and this was my very first time trying this kind of food. 

we started with beef satay; which was a tad bit of a disappointment to be honest; i am used to better satay with better tasting peanut sauce that we make at home. this version tasted very turmeric-ky and the peanut sauce didn't taste of peanuts. 

my friend ordered the hainanese chicken. she did so because she had a hainanese craving and she's tried this kind of cuisine before. i tasted a little bit and found it quite bland. i wouldn't recommend it to a first timer. 

i took to the images on yelp to select my entree. and ordered the wat tan hor fun. and oh, this dish is fun! when the plated soupy deliciousness arrived, i warned the server that i had ordered the regular one, not large. she smiled, and politely let me know that that thing, infront of me, was indeed regular. this regular could feed 4 people, no lies. so damn tasty though!! a little skimpy on the toppings - 4 prawns, 6 pieces of cuttlefish, 4 bok choys aswim - but this can be forgiven. that soupyness was out of the world. as were the flat noodles. i can go back for some more. 

final verdict: i am coming back. and next time when i do, i am ordering shareables. the portions are massive and the prices are good. i bet i could do a two people meal for $15 here.",4
"what's happened to secreto???  used to be a restaurant with high aspirations, and a legacy of the richardsons new mexico cuisine and jamie santoro cooking -- now half a step from a dive bar nowhere near flavor town.  booths replaced by high-top bar tables, menu with no idea of what it's trying to be (elephant garlic platter as an entree??), and indifferent service that kept us waiting 20 minutes (it was monday night and there were only 5 tables occupied - what was rushing you so much that you dropped the drink on the table with no eye contact, didn't bring requested water, then delivered soup and main course simultaneously?).  the ""tortilla"" soup was tasty, though without a actual tortilla in sight, and earns the second star; the rest wasn't poison but was totally lacking in new mexico seasonings and spices.  with los dos across the street i'm afraid there's no reason ever to come back. adiòs, pobrecitos.",2
"i just left a 4 day conference at this resort and was disappointed with the lack of attention to detail. the resort is huge and the layout is confusing, which is fine, if they had sufficient  signage detailing directions to each complex.  i suspect there were 400 participants at this conference and it was almost humorous watching the chaos as we tried to find meeting areas within the resort .  it would also be helpful if english was the primary language used by staff that was wandering about the complex.
 if you like extremely abrasive towels, this is your place. i am a fairly macho guy and the towels were so rough that air drying after a shower was a viable option and if you have any sunburn ( common in arizona ) god help you. as the sandpaper like grit of towels will have you whimpering in pain.  i certainly do not blame the staff, as they did there best, i blame the senior management.  it is quite obvious that cutting corners is the policy. ever hear of downy?  if you chose room service, beware of the pricing, i ordered a hamburger and a diet pepsi and my bill was $25, shame on me for not asking the cost.  though it was a tasty burger and the woman who delivered it was ultra pleasant.  for the money, you can do much better in the phoenix area.  i would avoid this place like the plague.",1
"service was the worst i can remember.  took too long to deliver the meal (they were not busy). the bread was stale. asked for new bread, it came after dinner was finished. asked for ketchup for the fries, it never came. took 8 minutes to get the check.  and the food was not worth what they charged for it.",1
"so much fun!  took a friend who had never experienced moroccan and she loved it.  she even danced with the belly dancer!  service was impeccable!  first thing they asked for allergies, dislikes, and intolerances; they accommodated without judging or hesitation.  soooo much food and everything was delicious.  it was late in a saturday and i made an open table reservation (1000 points!), and they knew it was us as soon as we walked in.  only made the reservation 25 minutes before.  i would definitely go back.",5
"this place is good for those who like this kind of thing.  well, duh, you say!  

i've been here several times with my family. they typically get chili-cheese dogs, italian sausages, fries, and sodas. so far, no complaints from any of them, and the kids want to go back any time we're in the area. 

i've had everything from salads to burgers, hotdogs (chicago-style and chili-cheese), tamales, even the italian beef (regular and large... and dry, wet, dipped, etc.) and whatever they call the combination italian sausage + italian beef thing. everything i have had has been fine. i think the chili is good, and the italian beef with cheese and spicy peppers is probably my favorite. get the gravy on the side so you can control how much goes on there. without the gravy, the sandwich can be a little dry, and when they ""dip"" it, the bread tends to fall apart before i'm finished with the sandwich -- and i eat pretty fast.

my only complaints are that the poppyseed muffins they serve with the salads tend to be dry and very bland, and the ""famous"" chocolate cake is not anything i find terribly special. for that matter, the salads have a nice variety, but i think they might be a little bland overall, too. but, i tend to like things with a little spice or vinegar tang to them, so take that critique for what it is worth. keep in mind that you need to pick up your salads near the ordering line, not at the place where you pickup all of your other food and drinks.

the lines move fast and the people taking the orders are friendly and efficient. the team that makes the food and calls out the numbers are likewise nice, and usually seem happy to grab a drink refill if you hang out by the order pickup area with your cup.",4

"updated review ..going backwards!
check in was easy because we checked in online and paid a small fee early registration. i think the resort fees are such a scam but no way out. they are 29.00 plus tax per day. 
we got a room on the carnaval
tower.. kind of a ""high roller"" view but you have to strain, lol. mostly parking lots. we got one of the newly renovated rooms. very well appointed but soooo non functional. you can't go into the bathroom and closet at the same time because of the ""barn door"" that slides between the two. the drawers are lacking but what they do have are modern style where you have to press to
open..one didn't work so we had to
open the one underneath and pull.
they had not installed the safes yet so we were offered the safety deposit boxes down stairs..annoying. 
linens and towels were cheap and meh. 
really would have preferred the old rooms. even though they are new still nicks and stains on the furnishings. the hallway carpets looked nasty and had dirty globs of food in one area that was never cleaned..this is the 3rd day of walking past it.
really disappointed that a free room was a loss for me. 
not excited about harrah's as future accommodations.",2
"ive gone to this place 9 times
the pizza is good, there service and wait time sucks
why did it take you guys 25 min to cook fries and then i got undercooked fries. this wasn't the first time they messed up, either, i gave them 3 chances now they are off my lunch rotation.
which sucks cos the food is good, but if you have a 30 min lunch skip this place coz you will wait 10 min  just for the cashier to charge you, and when you get back to work realize you fries arent cooked. just a big pain in the ass, again sad about having to break up with you mama depalmas, it was good while it lasted.

"alright although they had a fabulous selection of beer, the food was not to my liking....

i was very intimidated by the portions which are comparable to the size of a human head, so i decided to play it safe with a salad...big mistake. the salad was served in the exact same bowl my family and i use to serve salad at thanksgiving dinner no joke! it was filled to the brim with salad covered in tons of cheese, too much dressing, and less than extraordinary chicken.
 
so basically i had 3-5 bites and was done just because i was so grossed out. i wish the server would have mentioned the salad was big enough to feed the whole table and the one next to us. but he just completely ignored the fact i didn't eat any of it. but everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their gargantuan meals. i will not be going back to eat there.",2

"when your biggest issue is lighting for your food pictures, you know you have found a good spot. 

met my ladies for our semi-monthly lunch date. on first impression, i liked the aesthetic changes they made as this space was formerly dw bistro. (not that dw wasn't also adorable.) glasses of sparkling rosé were clinked, and we took on the world from our table in the cozy back corner of the main dining room. 

my friends both enjoyed lobster rolls (they looked good but a bit overdressed for my taste.) i ordered the thai chicken burger - and folks - it was so clucking good!!

the ground chicken was delightfully seasoned and served on a pretzel bun (yass!!) with a delicious aioli and sautéed peppers. duck fat fries were an option but i went with their lightly dressed mixed greens instead. it's been 24 hours and i'm still thinking about this burger, it's that good. 

when it was time to order dessert, one of my friends placed her order for the lemon tart, and our charming waiter asked if we would all be sharing it--and we laughed and laughed. two lemon tarts and a chocolate walnut gateau later and we were 3 very happy ladies. 

the lightly brûléed lemon wedge was a citrusy flavor explosion, and the tart itself was to die for. i tasted the gateau and it was also heaven on a plate.

we might not have been able to solve all of society's problems during this lunch date, but i'm sure we will give it a go again in the future, and i'm already planning a trip back with my husband for dinner. whoever said money can't buy happiness has clearly never eaten here.",5

"i was never really into taro... but my tastebuds have changed lately and i'm always looking for the freshest real taro in the city.

after reading some reviews on yelp (thanks yelpers), and checking out the photos.. i noticed that beau tea had a fresh taro special happening on wednesdays for $2.99.
i happen to be in the area on a wed afternoon so i decided to pop in.

the interior reminds me of a child's playground, with three giant teddybears sitting along the stools facing the outside window. the walls are cheery and pink but there were sadly no patrons in side.

i placed my order and the server kindly gave me his opinion, letting me know that my modification would not make the drink as tasty as it should be. i went with his suggestions and waited patiently as he blended the fresh taro with the milk tea, and then strained it (i think) into my cup. although it took much longer than i would have hoped, i was happy to see how creamy consistent the drink was throughout the entire cup.

at first sip... my eyes lit up and a grin spread across my face. the taro was lightly sweetened and very smooth. you can taste the ground up taro with every sip and the freshness of the root vegetable. for $2.99, i got a lot of love out of that drink and can't wait to go back for my next visit!",5
"delicious pastries especially the poppy-seed roll.  i liked the pretzels which were a bit sour but seemed authentic.  the beesting pastry was also very yummy, just wish there was more bavarian cream.  the sunflower bread was liked a lot by my bro-in-law, but sis, mom, and i weren't terribly fond.  they should have samples to try the different breads so that we can find one we like.  overall, appreciate the mom-and-pop aspect to the shop instead of the dreaded chains and the yummy goodies didn't hurt either.",4
"i am a frequent visitor at soyo and love this place a lot. this time, i would like to share several menu items while drinking alcohol beverages such as soju or macju(beer) :p the service has been truly excellent by the friendly staffs.. they seem to always be on the move, efficient, and very polite people. 

**corn cheese-basically corn baked with a cheese sauce in a sizzling hot pan that makes it gooey, crunchy, sweet, and salty. seems like they added some chopped onion, scallion, carrots, jalapenos(all kinds of veges), & panko bread crumbs(crunchy) for more flavors. it's a must-have in the appetizer! 

**starchy potato pancakes 'kamja jun'-it's under the special menu(written in korean on the wall)and their potato pancakes were really tasty! this pancake is made out of fresh potatoes, instead of flour (it's more healthier). because of this, the consistency and appearance of the pancake is quite unique, slightly chewy and almost translucent. the potato pancakes are the best served fresh off the pan so when it comes to your table, go ahead and enjoy it right away. me and my friends really liked this dish the most out of any appetizers :) 

**steamed pork, napa cabbage, & oyster 'bossam'-it's a cooked pork belly, you wrapped with nicely salted napa cabbage and tasty bossam kimchi. bossam kimchi is specially made for 'bossam' and it's more sweeter and more vegetables(radish & fresh oysters) in there compare to regular kimchi. for bossam, kimchi is not an option. it's one of main component to complete this dish. it also comes with ssamjang sauce (bean paste with sesame oil & garlic) and saeujeot (pickled fermented shrimp) that you can create you own style of ssam!!! it really depends on your preference and this is how i like to eat my bossam :) it can be really spicy so stay out of this dish if you can't handle the spiciness. 

**fried dumpling 'kun mandu'-the server told us that they make their own version of dumplings at soyo. the filling were clear noodles, ground beef, cabbage, scallion, onion, & firm tofu..it is best to eat immediately with vinegar-soy dipping sauce.",5

magnifico!  great little place tucked away in a semi-residential area of town.  felt like i was part of the family after being seated.  bright cheerful atmosphere like a fiesta!  food was very flavoful even the white rice.  crab enchiladas full of white crab meat and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce.  salsa you get red (spicy) and green (mild) with chips and i got a complimentary cerviche.  the red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just the right kick of heat.  can't wait to try other dishes when i return to phoenix in a couple of weeks!,4

omg i loved it! the salsa's (especially the hot!) the chips, the cheese crisp with green chiles and onions, and most of all: the chilaquiles!! i love chilaquiles so much and had mostly seen them only served at breakfast until i opened up manuel's menu and there they were, just how i like them! so good i wouldve licked the dish they were served in if i wasnt so full afterwards!

jd had a rolled quesadilla that was fantastic too and we both needed to be rolled out of there when we finished eating. it was so good though that i'm craving it again today. we will definitely be back!",5
"don't waste your time if you respect good service ! i'm in town from socal visiting my family that recently moved here and we were craving sushi ! to our luck there was a place with great reviews down the street. it's a monday at around 1, so we fully expected anywhere we went to be low key. we walked into rock lobster with high hopes cause it was cutely decorated and looked very nice. me, and my 2 brothers were ready to stuff our faces ! unfortunately we were ignored as we stood by the sign that read ""wait to be seated"". at least 4 mins went by (in a fairly empty restaurant) before we were greeted with a ""be there in a minute"" from a man who didn't even look at us. waited another few before a lady smiled and said ""he will be right there"" before he finally told us to have a seat at the table right in front of us. like you could have told us that immediately. then he placed menus with a pen without saying a word. i immediately hopped on yelp to find another nearby restaurant and we left. i will not give my money to people who don't deserve it. skip rock lobster if you care about how you're treated while having lunch or dinner.",1
"since my first review i've been back several times; sometimes for larger print jobs, sometimes for tiny ones. no matter what the job, they always get back to me quickly and if i need something printed asap they can handle it, despite being chronically busy.  always quality, always a good price, and always on time. i don't believe there's a better print shop in the valley.",5
this was lovely service.  this was the easiest trip from the airport to an actual city center that i have ever taken.  it was fairly cheap and a pretty direct route and wasn't in the slightest bit confusing.  the airlink drops you off right on the bridge that seems to link new edinburgh old edinburgh.  just a great connection.  it's reliable and convenient and the driver was friendly and helpful and i was quite pleased!,5
"it was a unique dining experience. the staff were incredibly nice. they are the most professional staff in the entire valley!!! they remembered our family on our subsequent returns.

this is a fun place for foodies and out of town guests with adventuresome palettes. depending on your family this can be a fun place for family outings. they were very accommodating and made a dish my 5 year old enjoyed!",4
"dr. hartman is the best optometrist. i live in new york and see him when i come home for the holidays. very knowledgeable and thorough. staff is super friendly and on top of it. great service, honest people, great everything - so happy i found this place.",5
"i

hate

las vegas.

that being said, this was an okay hotel.  i got the best room available to the public, and it was $130.  and it was decent.  so, that's not bad.  and the room service buffalo wings were decent, and only $10.  and that's not bad.  but they wanted to charge me for internet access.  which is bad.  and there was almost no way to plug in my laptop and sit on the bed and put together powerpoint slides, because the outlet was so far away.  and that's not good.  and i showed up to check in at 10:00 at night, and it took them 20 minutes to get me checked in.  and that's bad.  and, you can basically smoke anywhere in this place, much like most of las vegas, and that sucks.  listen, i have a lot of bad habits myself, so i'm not judging anyone.  but, i try not to inflict my bad habits on others (with fair-to-middling success).  'nuff said.

all in all, flamingo did an average job of housing me for the 22 hours i spent in vegas.  for the benefit of the las vegas tourism council, i will note:

1. i did not gamble with a single penny of money during that time;
2. i never left my hotel during that time;
3. the only alcohol i consumed was free, as part of the seminar i was speaking at.

thus, while my general prohibition on being physically present in las vegas was broken (through circumstances beyond my control), i held to my principles as closely as possible.",3
we stop here every time we are passing through. great alternative to fast food when we are on the road. we've had fantastic service and the food is fresh and hot. good value for money. mac and cheese and spaghetti are big hits with my daughter and we've tried a bunch of the other dishes.,4
"i like what the new owner has done to the store. i hated walking in to the old location, it was in a dead strip mall and i always felt awkward going in and leaving as the only customer in the store whenever i would go. the sales offered are much better than the previous owner but i would say things are still a bit over priced.

i've been to the new location twice and i had high hopes for things but i didn't feel very good about going back. the staff was  snotty on both occasions. you may have cute stuff but if i feel like those who are there to help are rude and focused on chatting up their own personal affairs rather than helping customers, i most likely won't be back. have a chat with your employees and teach them how they are supposed to treat those who want to spend their money to help support your business.",2
"the okinawa w\/ no boba... amazing. reminds me a bit of golden grahams, in the best way possible. love it!",5

"amazing view, and that's about it.

been wanting to check this place out ever since i moved in across the road. disappointing! 

despite it being virtually empty, the service was atrocious. bartender + kitchen staff were gossiping and joking the entire time. food was dry (okay, fine, you don't come here for the food, but still). 

i'd suggest you do a 180 and turn around!",2
"excellent flavors in multiple dishes. if the papaya salad was as spicy at 3, i can't imagine a 5 or higher. however, the flavors are awesome. tom kha soup could be easier to identify the lemon grass and keep it out of each bite. these are all nitpicky things because all of the food was phenomenal. will definitely be going back.",4
"i heard about this place while searching for good food in the area. i had never had new orleans-style food so i was pretty excited to try it. my friend and i arrived just ten minutes before the kitchen closed, but the sign said that they would be open another 40 minutes. we tried not to feel too guilty as we sat down in the empty dining room. we both served time in the service industry, so we know how shitty it is when someone sits down just before closing time.  despite this, our server was extremely cheery and wonderful, as was the chef, who actually stepped out to ask how the food was.

first of all, the decor is pretty loud and gaudy, but frankly i'm of the opinion that the uglier the restaurant is, and the ruder the staff are, the better the food is.. if the place has been around for years.

we started with the fish cakes which were served with a scotch bonnet aioli. they were really good, obviously hand-made because of their inconsistent consistency. next up we had the shrimp po'boy. i've never had one of these before, and actually didn't even know what it was. basically it was a lot of baby shrimp, in a super spiced up aioli in a crispy bun. it was pretty good, but salty. i'm not a huge fan of shrimp, so i wasn't a huge fan of this one. the fries were a little soggy, but they came with spray bottles of vinegar and malt vinegar! brilliant!

what we really enjoyed was the baxter's road fried chicken, which is what everyone is raving about on some other review i've read. it's a gigantic chicken breast, with a super thick and crispy breading on it that somehow manages not to be incredibly greasy. there was also a hint of honey on the breading. now, i don't usually like chicken breast, but this was really really good. very most and flavourful, possibly because of the little cache of spices we found embedded inside the middle of the breast. it also came with fries and a nice mixed salad with pineapples and mango dressing.

all in all, the good was great, as was the service. i will definitely go back again to order some of the other things on the menu and to take pictures! just be aware of the times when you go, it's closed sundays and mondays, and closes at 6:30pm on tuesdays and wednesdays.",4
"this is my favorite place to come after a long night of debauchery. the waitresses are attentive and friendly during the graveyard (from what i've experienced so far) and the food come out relatively fast. 
i've been here twice and have only ordered the biscuits and gravy so far (which is usually what i crave when i'm piss drunk) and it definitely hit the spot each time! the bacon is sooo good. the biscuits are huge and the eggs are cooked perfect each time. 
i live close by, so i'll be making more appearances here....next time i'll have to try those oreo pancakes....or maybe a slice a cake... i may just  head over there right now for a slice!",4
"nice gym and staff, but watch out for the contract. 

i have been a member for a year and asked to not renew my membership 28 days prior to the day i believed my membership ended.  well, it turns out that your membership never ends it auto renews for another year until you give them 30 days notice. because i was two days too late in my request not to extend my membership, i was charged for an additional month...which doesn't seem like much except when their monthly rate is over $100.  i asked if they could help me out and waive the extra month because i was just two days late in the notification.  they told me they couldn't because their third party billing company needs 30 days to cancel auto draft.  as someone in the industry, i know it does not take 30 days to cancel an auto draft.  

i would also like to point out that when they notified me that they would be charging me another month, rather than clearly spelling that out they just said i would be billed once more and they were prepared to extend my contract for 15 days (read i am paying for 30 days, yet they are making it seem like they are doing me a favor and extending it for 15 days).

the way it was handled was disappointing.  i signed a contract a year ago that stated i needed to put a 30 day notice in (that i of course didn't remember b\/c it was a year ago and in long document that i didn't absorb) so that was my fault, but i guess i just thought their customer service would be better.",2
"this is a top notch medical spa! not only is it clean and modern, but the staff is very knowledgable and professional. i have had 3 bodyfx treatments from hollie and started seeing results after the second treatment! she is great!! i loved the results, and her, so much i bought another package. i can't wait to try out all the other services they offer! try this place out...you'll love it!",5
"upon arrival, i was surprised to be greeted with rudeness by simply asking how this works and telling her this was my first time getting my teeth whitened. she retorted, ""your teeth are all going to fall out"". she then told me to ""let her do her job"" and instructed me to fill out the form. i accidentally completed more lines than what she had asked for and she told me ""i wasn't listening"". as a current teacher (and her being a former), it seems like she has a case of wanting to treat her clients as children. as the session went on, i heard her belittle a grown man sitting next to me and then even the next girl who came in. this young lady simply asked if this was her second 15 round and was told, ""yes it is, but you already knew that. didn't you hear me the first time i explained it?"" 

honestly, i bit my tongue, but i would never go back on principle alone. i am not the type of person to be disrespected or watch others be disrespected. if we're trusting a total stranger to whiten our teeth...who is not even a licensed dentist, the least we should be expected is to feel like we're in good hands. i still have no idea if she's licensed or properly trained. certainly none of that information was made available via phone or properly expressed before treatment.

basically, if you want your teeth whitened and are able to just show up and keep your mouth shut (like a good little boy\/girl), you'll be fine. if you provide any intelligent\/questioning thought, you might be ridiculed and\/or berated.",1
i was here yesterday afternoon. i really like the seating more than any other yogurt place. they have the usual toppings plus about 8 different syrups. the young gal who was there was so personable (she goes to calvary community church on i 17 (in case her boss is reading)) and she is a definite asset to this establishment.,4
"we dined at the 360 restaurant for our one year wedding anniversary. having dined at similar high end restaurants in toronto we were expecting similar service and food portion\/quality. 

needless to say we were blown away with the service and the food was spectacular. we opted for the price fixed menu and were allowed to switch items from both menus. we both had the beef tenderloin and shared frites with the truffle sauce. both were incredible and the flavours were perfect. 

the appetizers we had (caesar salad & cheese tart) was a great way to get ourselves ready to enjoy a great meal. 

the view was spectacular once you adjust to the casual spinning floor. you get to experience some breathtaking views. yesterday was a great sunny blue sky day and toronto never looked better!

highly recommend",5
"they call themselves mandarin beijing mian? what should a beijing-broth taste like? like ramen?
in china old chef school defines three levels of broth.
mao tang (street level) - thick broth, lots of fat, usually from remains of pork with blood. lots of flavor at 1st hit.
ii. hong tang (formal dinner level) - red broth, less fat, clearer taste  with increasing back-kick flavor. usually only from pure beef or pork bone with minimal blood. only quality soya should be used and absolutely not overdosed.
iii. qing tang (banquet level) - transparent broth, minimal fat, clean or ""tasteless"" taste at first shot but eh - you got your face punched by the huge fresh back taste. usually only from whole old chicken, fresh (must be no dry food) shrimp, fish and abalone.
all broth lives forever by cleaning replacing broth ingredients.thick broth is very popular in toronto now because of ramen-mania. after 1700s ramen was exported by an escaped prince in ming dynasty. japanese improved mao tang by adding miso and seaweed. some dried ingredients were also attempted. for downtown toronto in my opinion, sansotei gets the best thick broth now which reminds me a famous ramen bar in osaka called ichiran . both santoka and kinton somehow has more or less concentrated broth taste. other places simply add powder.
in terms of hong tang, besides a taiwanese cozy restaurant in markham village named mama beef noodle. i have only tasted noodle face.
the broth was plain at first, but it shaken me after the 3rd spoon with hinder beef bone flavor melting my stomach and then mouth. and yeah, no heavy soya taste, i loved it.

i asked the server if the broth was somehow related to china because it reminds me beijing's ox street beef noodle soup 3 years ago when my grandparents treated me this. and yes. they imported the broth from beijing by somehow (how they sneaked out of canada custom?!).
the noodle is good, but can be better with more strength though. 

service was friendly and fast considering the price i paid. well no reasonable customer expects any server hangs the dinner napkin for you in any single-digit budget restaurant.

overall my experience is as 4.5 stars (-0.5 star because of the softer noodle) but the other half was left as benefit of doubt and price. for this quality of food, blogto is quite accurate - serious bang for your buck. 

portion was like two bowls of sansotei mixed together. 10 years ago maybe i finished easily but now i just couldn't.

next week i will try some of their other dishes.

in case of qing tang...yeah full house restaurant and mingmen banquet does this, but not as well as those 5 star restaurant i had in china. southern chinese does best at qingtang, go to hangzhou or yangzhou to find out yourself.

a tip: if you end up drinking more than a can of water after having any noodle soup, consider yourself cheated by some non-organic dry stuff melted in the soup already. there were a few ramen places not backstaged by authentic japanese owners doing this, and i hated them. yet mainstream customers just get blind by their ramen branding and years of msg sauteed tongues. figure out these places yourself.",5
"if it was possible to leave 0 stars, i would do that. their service was absolutely terrible along with their attitudes. it took 30 minutes to get our food in the drive through even though we were one of 2 cars there. do not eat here if you want fast service and good service. can't emphasize enough how terrible the service was here and how their attitudes were like wet rags.",1

the food is decent, but the size and comfort level are fantastic.  i don't care for the free stuff, as much as i like a quite place to relax before flying.  

check out the pictures i posted, then visit the lounge.  this place blows the other canadian lounges out of the water.",5

the good is very good and the meh is pretty meh. the good -- salt and pepper sea bass, spicy wontons, most of the noodle dishes. the meh -- dan dan noodle (how can you screw up dan dan noodles?) and the dim sum.",3

"dana realty group absolutely deserves the 5 star ratings here on yelp. wendi (the owner) is one of the nicest and most real person i have ever had the pleasure of doing business with. even when i had to delay renting my home out for several months while working through divorce proceedings, i never felt pressured by wendi and in fact she was absolutely supportive of making things work out on my timeline. her flat fee is a bargain and her attention to detail when it comes to making certain my home is kept in good condition with reliable tenants is awesome. wendi is also super responsive by phone or text messages, at most within 24 hours and usually within a few minutes of trying to contact her i will get a response back. i am a very satisfied customer of wendi's and i would recommend her to anyone requiring property management services.",5
"i brought my mom to the phoenician's spa for her brithday in march and we couldn't have enjoyed it more.  we hung around the pool all afternoon, then enjoyed treatments.  i did the reflexology, which was very relaxing.  my mom enjoyed her massage also.  the entire experience was very nice, but as we didn't acutally stay there, i have nothing to say about the rooms.  if they were taken care of as well as the grounds, this would be a wonderful place to stay.",5

carpaccio .... amazing with arugula and parmesan.  

cavatelli with meat sauce and ricotta amazing   

seabass- light with a lemon sauce. yum

chicken marsala... mouth is still watering. 

seafood alfredo. shrimp, scallops, in a light cream sauce. yum! not overtly thick at all! 

tiramisu ... no go for me. just too much.

",my husband, daughter and i stopped in on a saturday morning for breakfast. we loved the atmosphere, well that was probably more me but still. it was very open and had a cheerful vibe to it. our waiter was attentive and stopped in to check on us a good amount without being pushy. 

now onto the food... i tried the corned beef benedict which was very flavorful with caramelized onions and hollandaise sauce in the mix. my husband tried the wolf pack and had nothing but good things to say about it. though i can't remember what my daughter had, i do know she ate it all. plus, the orange juice is fresh-squeezed and we all adored it.

i can't say it is my absolute favorite place for breakfast but i do know we will be back!",4
if i could i would give this a negative 0 waited over 25 minutes for them to bring out a pan of mac and cheese for my 5 year old who was hungry and that's what he asked for to have for lunch remind you he has food allergies so i bring him here once a week ended up saying forget it get to the cash register to be treated so rudly a lady by the ranee said that's not my problem i'm not in the department and made no attempt to help me out i highly doubt i will be shopping with this company again there lack of customer service or trying to make things right is horrible,1

"i needed some posters and artwork printed for an event and sml were the only ones that could turn the work around quickly. a lot of printers are offended by the very notion that you could need something in a hurry (it happens, guys) but tom was understanding and non-flustered by my request. i was pleased at the quick communication by e-mail and phone.

when i went to pick up the materials they were packaged up neatly in a box. i didn't have a chance to inspect the materials at the store, but when i got home i was blown away. the quality of cardstock was was exceptionally high and the colours were super vibrant. everything was shrinkwrapped which was a nice touch also; it suggests they take a lot of pride in their work -- and they should.

if you have a have a project that demands a high level of quality and care, you need to take it to sml. these guys seriously rule.

obligatory title pun: no job too small, medium or large.

menu readability: great logo.

need to mention: they are only open during office hours. 

what this place teaches me about myself: few things make me as happy as a well-printed poster.",5

"one word: awful.

1st dish: kare-kare lunch special - 
veggies on top (beans and eggplant) was cold! as in straight out of a tupperware container from the fridge cold! as with the two mini lumpia shanghai that comes with it - they too, were cold. we were scratching our heads,  puzzled. when we asked the mgr, he said they pre-cook the veggies (which was understandable), but he said they shouldn't have been cold. he brought back and returned to us heated. taste of the kare-kare was one of the worst i have had.

2nd dish: palabok
didn't get any better. generous portion,  but definitely lacking quality and taste of this dish - very disappointing.  had a several mouthfuls, but eventually gave up. i felt bad having to leave so much food, but it was unpalatable :-(

3rd dish: pata tim
i had to throw my towel in - i didn't even taste this one. my family did though only to discover that this dish may have been the culprit of possibly food poisoning? my mother had a very upset tummy with nausea all afternoon.\/evening! i may be insinuating,  but for good reason. please be cautious! 

i recently ate at cafe de cebu and their food was much better tham dt's. i hate to compare and name drop, but for those who are craving filipino food, i would recommend you to go there instead.",1
love this place. i always crave the ex gf roll! best place for ayce on the nw part of town.,4
wow i always find great clearance deals here. cleanest store around and great selection. the employees here are pretty friendly and offer to help locate something when you are browsing the store. i'm pretty picky about grocery stores and will go out of my way to return to a store that provides good service and a good shopping experience.,5
"there's two sides to rasta pasta, one that involves caribbean food with pasta and the other side has more traditional dishes with rice and veggies. we visited both. we had the alfredo gnocchi with jerk meatballs which was really good and also had the jerk chicken with steamed veggies and rice. the jerk sauce was so good. not much seating, more of a take out place, but decent service. the pasta chef made some really good suggestions on variations to his dishes.",4

the first time i went, a lady left her disgusting coffee cup on the check out counter(where i would need to place my items). this second time, while checking out the cashier asked for ""a little help unloading the basket"" which is only appalling because there was no one in line in front of or behind me.  i actually normally unload the basket (which btw had all of 5 items in it), but i figured i'd save us both time by allowing her to do her job without waiting for me to go through the unnecessary steps. she proceeded to slam my receipt down on the counter rather than put it in the bag or simply hand it to me. disappointing. i will not be back.",1

"ich war am samstag (20uhr-film) in ""alice im wunderland"" für 10eur. ich hatte die karten auch schon vorreserviert und wollte 19.30uhr da sein, um sie rechtzeitig abzuholen. das erste riesengroße problem war schon mal die parkplatzsuche, da alle umliegenden parkplätze und -häuser voll waren. da habe ich mich dann in irgendeine nebenstraße stellen müssen. als wir dann ankamen, traf uns fast der schlag, weil die schlange fast bis um die ecke ging. es waren ja auch nur 2 kassendamen da, die die leute abfertigen mussten. wir waren dann 19.50uhr an der kasse und zum glück waren unsere karten noch nicht verfallen, sonst wäre ich komplett ausgerastet. ich kenne das von anderen kinos (cinemaxx) überhaupt nicht, dass man so lange anstehen muss, da immer mindestens 6 kassen offen sind. das nächste problem war dann die popcorn-schlange. man musste sich echt vorbeidrücken, damit man überhaupt ins kino kommt. das ist eine minikleine theke und da stand auch nur 1 thekenmann. das war wirklich unglaublich. zudem waren die sitze wirklich abgesessen und der boden war völlig verklebt. der sound war auch sehr schlecht. 
wir haben deshalb auf knabbereien verzichtet und haben den film von der ersten minute an genossen. der film ist wirklich empfehlenswert.
aber das kino nicht. wir werden nicht nochmal hingehen- wir werden dann doch lieber stuttgart bevorzugen.",2
"stopped by for my first time the other night and i know i'll be back. my husband and i had some free time and thought a glass of wine by the lake would be nice. time to check out the cottage...!

if you like wine, you'll be like a kid in a candy shop when you walk in. wine, wine everywhere!  there were some people there, already enjoying their wine and the employee stepped up and asked us what we were looking for. it was a hot night so we opted for a white. she knew her wines and eventually recommended an awesome pinot grigio (i usually avoid them - turns out i was drinking the wrong ones!). 

she poured our wine and we went outside to enjoy the evening. she quickly brought out some pretzels to munch on and checked on us a couple times. great service!

after we finished the glass, she bagged the remainder of our bottle and home we went. great place and we'll be back!!  next time, with friends!",5
"i have been taking my pets to animal health services for close to 10 years.  they have extended hours and with several doctors on staff any given day it is easy to get an appointment.   every doctor i have had the pleasure of working with has been knowledgeable, kind and an advocate for my pets health.  the facility has state of the art diagnostic equipment and while some complain services are costly, i don't feel there is a clinic that can compare to what they have to offer.  the services offered are not ""pushed"" but rather suggested to maintain a lets healthy living.  particularly comforting is to know they have an after hours emergency clinic.  we had a dog diagnosed with lung cancer that began have breathing difficulties in the middle of the night. we knew it was time to put him down and thank goodness he did not have to suffer until morning.  the after hours vet was kind and compassionate and i'm grateful they were there.  for people who feel this clinic is too costly, i would argue you get what you pay for.",5
been twice.  chicken roti was really good.   very fresh.  nice staff.  curry chicken and rice was really tasty. some tables and lots of customers getting takeout.  recommended.,5
"wow! i'll never go to any other hospital for care. they always explained everything to me. even every medication, how much, and why i'm taking it. the food was awsome. the rooms are inviting and the staff always had my interest in mind first. they all worked together and seemed happy to be there. they where quiet at night and keep everything very clean. i've never seen people wash there hands so much. such a positive environment for healing.",5
"love the pad thai - their pad thai is not greasy and when i order the beef pad thai, it also has tofu. panang curry is also good. i went to this restaurant three times this past week :)",4
"my girlfriend and i have seen this place several times while driving down warner, and always wanted to try it out. it's located right next door to sushi san in an otherwise pretty barren strip-mall area, so it's not hard to find.

it's a tiny little place, with only three to four tables inside. the decor could best be described as ""sweet country grandma butterfly haven"", with one manekineko in a small pot off in a corner. there's a big board in the back with the prices of bulk to-go wares (i guess...??), and a cold-display counter showing off the goods.

the menu is two-sided, with one side for white people and the other for chinese people. i say that, because (like damned near everywhere else we've been) the waitress expressed utter disbelief when we ordered from the chinese side. i laughed inside, because this is the first time that my girlfriend (who is mexican) has seen this in action. i always jokingly tell her that one day i'm going to get a shirt which says in chinese ""yes, i eat weird shit like this all the time"". anyways... we ordered the dan dan noodles, and two rice dishes (one with rib and tripe, the other with ear and tongue), and two teas. after again reassuring the waitress that yes, we genuinely *do* eat shit like this all of the time, we settled in for our meal.

our food came out, and it was... fine. it was just fine. this place specialized in offal. in fact, one of the first questions that came to my mind was:  ""can you actually get duck *meat*?"". you can get duck wings, head, tongue, feet, gizzards, but no breast meat. same with pork and beef- no actual meat, just the ""other stuff"". which isn't a problem, and i'm always down for a good offal dish, but i'd imagine that some people would come here looking for some good duck meat and might be put off by the lack of it.

anyways... our food was fine. not great, just fine. the meats were tasty but (and god knows how i hate saying this) not as good as many close-by options (which i won't name, but if you read my other reviews you'll see). each dish had a lump of white rice and a smattering of microwaves peas and carrots, which maybe turned me off more than it should have. the dan dan noodles were actually really tasty, and if possible i'd have given half a star for them alone.

all in all, this place is fine, but i think that it's definitely geared more towards chinese residents who are yearning for a taste of home. other places with larger (and more diverse) menus will do well in attracting new customers and meeting curious guailos halfway, but i don't see hot duck making much of a splash. i noticed several posters on the way out, and i guess this restaurant is a franchise from la? at any rate, i don't see any reason to return here, unless i'm wanting to bring home a half-pount of duck tongues (which i hear are amazing, but... yeah).",3
"update: i called back to schedule another appointment with jane and was told rather abruptly that she no longer worked there and that this location was not taking appointments because they had no esthetician. it came off as quite sketchy and unprofessional. with multiple locations, i'm surprised there is not adequate staff to cover them in situations like this. in addition, the way it was communicated left me with a lot of questions regarding the turnover. 

i received a nice email last week that they have hired a new esthetician and that she is running a special, but i have decided to go elsewhere for these services.",2
"we came here this morning; she ordered thai boba tea; i had a coconut-taro boba smoothie.  both were delicious; the coconut predominated in my smoothie, but that is the nature of the beast - taro is not a strong flavor.  so, on we went for more eating and shopping elsewhere, then, later in the afternoon, we returned.  pretty full by then, but we had to have a bowl of pat bing su, which we split between us.  it was large and covered with fruit, pat (aduki beans cooked with sugar), tteok, malt powder, lots of bobas...  this was a very complex version of this dish and very tasty.  good to the last bean and the last boba.  

the bobas were well-prepared - firm but not too hard, and plenty of them. it's the one item there that i haven't found in patbingsu before, but it blends in well.  

there's lots of things to drink on the menu, one could spend many an hour exploring the possibilities.  my smoothie was a combo of two menu items, so, yeh, you can try it however you think it might be good.",5
"we've gone to this place a dozen times since first finding it because the food is darned good. but on our latest visit, we were shortchanged on portion sizes on our takeout order and there was no coleslaw included with our order as promised. is this the way to treat new regular customers? get it together, pili pili -- dishonesty and ripping off people is guaranteed to lose you a customer any old day. to everyone who frequents this place or wants to try it -- check your order each time to make sure you get what you paid for. disgusting.",1
"we've been to the arrowhead location a few times and each time it gets worse. the food is usually pretty decent, but their service is terrible. the manager is terrible. he is more concerned with flirting with the girls behind the counter than the customers. tonight, our pizza was so under cooked. manager was irritated that i asked for an extra plate. i love their good, but their service makes me not want to return.",3
"you can't beat their meat

top veal sandwich in the area, fantastic sauce, price of sandwich $7.50 for the veal includes free toppings (not incl cheese).  my fave is everything less the cheese, great hot peppers, lots of onions & mushrooms.

nice selection of pasta, dry & fresh, meats & sauces as well as breads

"false advertising on here that says that this place is vegan and gluten free. i came here thinking there would be lots of vegan options and that all pastas would be gluten free. the only vegan pastas they offer are zoodles. not very flexible and not very many options for vegans. they need to stop saying that they are vegan. instead, they could say vegetarian friendly. would be a much better indicator of what the restaurant truly is.",1

what took me so long to return is what i keep asking myself after visiting the place on new year's day. i had a tasty trout dish and a butter tart for dessert. the tart was not only huge but probably one of the best tasting tarts i have had in a long time. it had a flaky crust and filling that was just the right amount of gooey.,4

"you can often get this hotel pretty cheap on websites like hotel.com, and it's nicer than other options in its lower price range. one big draw for me was that the casino wasn't smokey or smelly. it actually smelled good if you can believe that, but it's true. 

pool: the pool area was busy, and there were several pool options, including a wave pool and a lazy river. it had a family-friendly-holiday inn vibe to it, even though there were a lot of drunk twenty-somethings wandering around. the hot tub was dominated by people who would've been great models for ed hardy swimwear. 

rooms: our room was nice with traditional decor. mostly simple with white and gold decorations. our room was clean, and the bed was very comfy. on our floor, it was a mix of people wanting to party and families. 

food: the location of monte carlo is convenient to a lot of food options, but if you ever get lazy, the buffet is good and the food court is convenient. 

deal or no deal: there is the most amazing slot machine ever--the deal or no deal slot machine--and there is always a long line to play it, but once you get in, it is really fun and pays out well (for the most part.) this elusive machine isn't found in many casinos in las vegas, but there is one machine at monte carlo.",5
"best club i've ever been to... hands down!

i'm trying to figure out why this place works.. here's my oh-so-deep analysis:
there are a few reasons people decide to leave clubs, but all those problems have solutions at xs:

problem: too stuffy
solution: the circulation is amazing at xs given that one whole wall is gone from the already large, high ceiling-ed club. you never feel stuffy, no matter how vigourously you dance! 

problem: too sober, but too cheap to buy yo-self another drink
solution:  there is no roped off vip section at xs, so you can freely mingle with those-who-have-table-service. which increases the chance of you getting invited over to get plastered, for free. 

problem: too pained by your shoes
solution: this is probably the most unique part of xs: there is a pool area, where you can take off your shoes, take a dip, and juuuust dance.",5
"another great burger chain! i love seeing quality fast food burger joints pop up all around the city and the country. these establishments have a cornered out a great segment in the market and have tons of potential for growth in the coming years. 

i tried the habit after reading an article online that surveyed costumers from all around the country as to which high-end burger joints would they most want to move into a city near them. to my surprise is was not in-n-out or five guys at the top of the list - it was the habit. having never heard of them before i was delighted to find that we here in phoenix are lucky enough to have one in out downtown area. as soon as i got my food i could clearly see what all the fuss online was about. this burger rocks! most notably the habit uses really fresh ingredients, the cheese is perfect and tasty, and the onions are grilled to perfection and plentiful. i order a side of fries and a chocolate malt to accompany my burger. the fries were nothing special. i was really expecting a whole lot more and was disappointed to find how basic they were. however, the chocolate malt was the best i have had all summer! i would highly recommend giving the habit a try the next time you are downtown.",4

"this place is a music junkyard. big store, full of movies, cd's and vinyl.

i am mostly into vinyl. unfortunately the used vinyl here is poorly organized and they don't seem to look at what they put out. prices are relatively cheap. unfortunately anything at all interesting was scratched up and basically a coaster. these people have no clue what a good condition record is apparently.

i saw many people coming in to sell so my guess is turnover is pretty high. perhaps i hit them at a bad time.

counter staff are young and basically standing around day dreaming. i did find a few music dvd;s. they re-shrink wrap everything. i didn't think they would do it to rip people off but when i opened my purchases later there was damage on each disc. bad damage. other stores wont even buy discs in this condition. zia buys them, reshrinks them and sells them. obviously customers are suckers to them.

"my bourbon orange julep was pretty tasty.  cornbread was a little overcooked and tasted a bit weird.  rock shrimp and calamari app was good.  the lo mein salad was tasty but spicy, didnt care so much for the accompanying spring roll.  my fish was ok, the accompanying basmati rice with some kind of vanilla sauce was good.  the side dishes of parmesan asparagus and the mac n cheese were ok as well.  nothing stood out as spectacular.  they undercooked my co0workers' steaks, but fixed that promptly.",3

obviously it's a cafe\/bakery, so the coffee and baked goods are phenomenal.

but a lot of people don't realize that their food menu is also to die for.  breakfast or lunch - i have always had a good meal.  great salad greens on the side with a refreshing vinaigrette.  in the winter, i always get a huge bowl of their hearty soup with fresh bread on the side.  there isn't anything better.  for some reason, every time i have the soup, i swear it's the best soup i've ever had.  it happens again and again. 

also, i've done some work on my computer there during less busy hours - great place to grab some coffee and get stuff done.

"happy hour. if you're looking for happy hour just stop reading and start driving now. i've been to their happy hour twice now after loving the food the first time. initially i was going to give 4 stars for amazing deals and food but a continually missing waiter. the second time i went i probably had the most pleasant waitress i've encountered in years so now yard house is golden in my eyes. i believe her name was nicole? 

she started off by asking us if we had been there \/ what kind of beers we liked \/ if we had tried any on the menu. she then asked us if we wanted her to pick out two samples she thought we might like which i thought was such a nice gesture. the two she picked for my roommate magically happened to be two of the ones she had been wanting to try so she's apparently got a knack for reading people. she was the perfect amount of attentive yet not overbearing and genuinely friendly instead of the creepy ""what can i get you honey?"" *rests hand on shoulder* thing i hate. 

we ordered the chicken nachos and spinach dip. honestly the nachos are massive and only $7. best. deal. ever. both were delicious and, as much as i want to try new things, they were so good i can't not order them. struggles. i'm usually a snob against chain restaurants but yard house is worth a try. (additionally they have a round up for charity option which melts my heart.)",5

great food and great prices. i would have loved to try something from the drink menu but i was on duty. the place was absolutely packed during lunch time which is always a good sign of excellent food. i would recommend this place to everyone.,5
my experience was mediocre at best. after using the thing on my heels they were rough. she barely let me soak 5 minutes in the spa pedicure and the place was empty - no waiting. it's directly across the street but i will drive further out for a better experience. i like to be pampered. at least give me some time to relax before you're pulling my feet out. it just wasn't the friendly accommodating experience i'm used to.,2

"just had my third experience at amon ami gabi this morning. my first two experiences were phenomenal. the service and food was incredible. shout out to nicole who took care of us and delivered what was truly a world class experience. 

my reason for 4 stars is because of my experience with wait staff today. my waiter didn't share any specials with us, he didn't check on us once during our meal, he charged us for table bread, and our hashbrowns were so over salted that they were inedible. would have loved to ask him about the $4.95 table bread charge and let him know about the salted potatoes, but he truly gave me no opportunity to do so. 

management, hire more nicole's!!",4

"the location, facilities and instructors are absolutely hands down phenomenal at this yoga tree location. 

i had originally signed up for the 30 day unlimited yoga intro package for $40 in the month of december. at the time i was looking for a place that was convenient for me to become more physically active. although i must admit, this was not the best time to purchase the pass because i was not able to optimize the full potential of my pass due to the limited classes offered closer to the holidays. nevertheless, my goal was to try a variety of different classes within those 30 days to decide whether or not i'd be interested to invest more time practicing at this studio. 

on my first day, i loved every single moment of my experience. entering this studio was like coming to a 5-star spa retreat, from taking your shoes off at the door to smelling the relaxing aromas in the studio. the receptionist was very informative and helped me register my 30-day pass. the change room was very modern, with built in lock combination lockers. they have a hang out area along with a hydration station where there is complimentary tea, fruit infused water and filtered water.

the studio offers a variety of different classes and all of the yoga instructors i had were very knowledgeable and approachable. i attended 12 classes with 5 different instructors within the month of december. each class allowed me to learn more about yoga through the techniques and postures that were taught.

below are some tips, the top 3 things i loved about this studio and a few recommendations i had.

tips:
- in partnership with local businesses in the neighbourhood, your pass allows you discounts to places like bareburger, aroma, fresh, etc...
- they offer free tea and fruit infused water
- 10% off for students purchasing the auto-renew program

what i love:
- environmentally friendly studio by minimizing the environmental footprint by using energy efficient materials like cork flooring, energy saving light bulbs and enforcing a no-paper policy
- the community initiatives that help raise awareness and funds for multiple organizations 
- the pass allows you access to 5 locations (however some of the locations are very far from one another)

recommendations:

affordable class: 
this location is predominantly university students, which makes it very challenging for students like myself to afford this luxury. it would be great if this location offered the economy $10 admission for everyone with or without yoga tree memberships (like their richmond & spadina location). 

i loved this studio so much after my first day, i decided to sign up for the auto-renew program on dec 21(fully paid) even though my last day was december 31. i didn't attend my first class in january until january 4th and learned that they had a promotion on january 7th for 50% off the 1st month of auto-renew. i was very upset at this because if i procrastinated long enough, i could have saved more money. after speaking to the yoga advisor, i had learned that i was not able to retrieve the difference back. the auto renew program is a minimum commitment of four months for $99. by saving $50, i would have been able to put it towards another months membership fee.

new student orientation: 
although i was provided directions to the change rooms and the studio rooms, it would have been great if there was a guided tour for new students to orient them around the facility, as well as explain\/demonstrate how to use the lock in the locker rooms. 

class variety: 
all the yoga tree locations offer some different classes; for example, only the richmond & spadina location offer the jivamukti class, only the richmond hill location offer iyengar & yoga with meditation, etc... 
it would be nice to see some of these classes offered at the bay & dundas location from time to time (eliminating travel time to far locations such as vaughan & richmond hill).

overall, i love attending the 6:30am - am power flow classes with stefanie on tuesday and thursday. it's a great challenging class and it's a great start to my day. i would most definitely recommend everyone and anyone to come to her classes.",4

"i ordered appetizers and drinks with a friend, which were great, but the service sucked. kyle was our ""waiter"", and i don't know what drugs that kid is on, but he needs to share with his customers if he would like to be deemed slightly tolerable. he didn't put our drink order in until we were served our appetizers (i was wondering why he kept asking me if i wanted lemon in a water i didn't have), and he kept relaying our drink order incorrectly to the bartender. he would come to ""check"" on us with, ""is everything ok? "" only to rudely turn around and walk away before we could get a word in. he did this literally 5 times.  unfortunately, i have had comparable service at this same location so i doubt this will be an option for me in the future.",2

"after a suggestion from our wedding coordinator, we switched from a previous dj to mt sounds and could not have been happier. our previous dj was not professional and had misplaced our contract and was questionning our deposit which we gave him! mt sounds actually played at our wedding coordinator's wedding just a couple months previously and she highly recommended this company. we were lucky that matt from mt sounds was available! his set up was not too bulky and he was very responsible and talented. he has a great ""dj voice"" and was always making sure we were sticking to our time table. the entire night flowed very smoothly and without a hitch! if you want a no-fuss dj service that is excellent, pick mt sounds!",5
"we are coming back! often! the service, the fun atmosphere, and the food! so delicious! i had the chicken gyro with their home made tzaziki sauce, my daughter was in heaven with their lemon pepper chicken, broccoli, and syrian rice (pilaf with chicken broth), and my husband had the envy of them all, a taco fold over! delicious!",5
"i can't count the number of unhappy hair-dos i've sported while searching for a capable, visionary hairstylist: you know, that legendary artist whose medium is equally hair and geometry, who understands not only that you want your hair to make you look good (crazy!) but who can also can visualize what may suit you and even create it, with painstaking meticulousness and a bevy of exotic combs.

imagine my pleasure to find not one but two of these rare creatures, and from the same salon!

vanessa and skyler did my hair last night for a fashion show, and they did an epic job. they prettied up the seven of us models with that big, dreamy bedroom hair of the '50s and '60s. when they took my hair out of the rollers and brushed it out, i was amazed. they had transformed me--i was that kind of lady who puts lipstick on before she gets out of bed and wears three inch ""bedroom slippers"" with fur tufts everywhere. first of all, that kind of glamour doesn't exist anymore and it was awesome to see irl. second, i don't think my hair has ever looked better. and third, this is the holy grail of hair!: when a hairstylist can make your hair look a way that you could never possibly imagine, and opens up a whole new realm of how you could look.

v+s did this for all the girls. they customized a look for each of us that flattered our features and our style while maintaining the overall line of the theme. and they did so with professionalism, grace under time constraint, and pleasant attitudes!

i can't wait to visit them at palabra and actually get a haircut there. i have total faith that i could walk in there and say, ""i'm in your hands, i want to do something different,"" and i would actually leave looking good. and happy.

go try it.",5

"prague is always one of my favourite places to go for a bacon-and-eggs breakfast in toronto, and i've spent countless hours sitting at the counter by the window, alone, drinking coffee, eating my breakfast (although, to be fair, it's usually afternoon), and reading books.
this is a family-owned business which, if the photos on the walls tell the correct story, seems to have been a butcher shop originally. now they're a restaurant, bakery, and small grocer - you can pick up items ilke eastern european chocolate bars, bags of perogies to take home, and even homemade plum preserves, delicious on buttered toast.

"i absolutely loved this place. it smelled very nice in there and mom did my pedicure. she is so gentle and very sweet. i suffer from ingrown toenails on several of my toes and she took care of all of them and it didn't hurt one bit! so impressive! she also gives a wonderful leg message. i am not from the area but the next time i am in vegas, i plan to go see mom so that i can get another awesome pedicure!

btw, the prices are pretty standard. i paid $35 for my pedicure and it was the mid-range one on the nail menu.",5
never go here again! i was greeted and i sat at the bar and 30 minutes no one greeted me or ask for my drink order. poor customer service! my first time in the area and i won't return to this bar. very rude and sad to see everyone in the bar being service and no one address me(only black couple in the bar). so i left feeling like wow!!.,1
"definitely recommend cactus tint great service and awesome work i just had my chevy suburban and uncles bmw x5 done they did an excellent job ,rick provides great service and impeccable window tinting! he gives excellent customer service and honesty that many of us are looking for. definitely recommend to everyone! the material is of the highest quality and rick works with such passion and treats all cars as if they were his own. overall great place to go for your window tinting needs they work fast and do incredible work.",5

"at least one of the mechanics used an impact wrench on every bolt under the hood. seven bolts were stripped and two holes elongated they had to be rebored.

nothing was torqued to specs.

the harmonic balancer bolt was overtightened to breaking the 1\/4 "" thick washer behind it in 3 places. then they siliconed the broken washer back together !

mr carlos (manager) was not at all interested in looking at the stripped bolts and broken washer we brought in to show. very dismissive and defensive. which shows complicity in my opinion.

dangerous shop.",1

"monday's are free fries day!!! 
very great place, friendly staff and you get your money's worth. however i wasn't a fan of the drinks.. soft drinks are 3\/4 of ice. i had to get multiple refills. refills we're free.. and i had the rib taco nice but 2bucks worth of food, if you know what i mean. i wish i took a picture with something to compare the tacos with. my mother got the burger it was nice size for what i paid, i just so happened to come on a monday, staff informed me it's free fries day (free with only if you purchase a hamburger). thanks for reading.",4
this was a fun way to spend a couple hours in vegas. the actors are funny and don't make you feel embarrassed when you have to interact. in the end you find out if you have what it takes to be part of the mob family. good luck! overall good time and learned a bunch about the history of mob and vegas.,4
"wow, i don't remember the last time i spent $40 for a burger and a shake. that's right, because i never did! granted this was vegas, but it wasn't like i was at a buffet or anything.

though i was stuffed, and probably in a better way than if i had gone to a buffet, i left wondering how i ended up spending $40 (tax+tip included) on a burger and a shake. oh yeah, it was an alcoholic shake. but why couldn't i taste the whiskey? seriously, i'm not that much of a heavy drinker, either. that $13 pumpkin pie shake, while heavenly delicious, did not have a single trace of alcohol in it.

like a studious yelper, i did my homework and listened to steph c.'s rec and opted for the rising sun (kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado). i've never had fried avocado let alone on a burger! the crispy yam was also new for me, but man was that kobe beef patty delicious. medium rare perfection with that sweet and savory terikayi glaze. for those who don't know, nori furikake is a popular japanese condiment which is like seaweed seasoning. it usually has sesame seeds, dried\/ground fish, sugar, salt, and you guessed it, msg. while i can't be sure holstein's furikake had msg, it definitely did not deter me from devouring that burger. it was not missing any flavor, and i couldn't be happier with the food in front of me. the fries were also delicious, but that burger was pretty unforgettable. it definitely doesn't come close to the best burger i've had, but props for making me want to return and try other menu items. next time, it might have to be the big fat greek (greek spiced lamb with feta cream, lettuce, tomato, red onion & olive relish, w\/tatziki sauce) or the billionaire burger (kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo). what can i say, i love a good burger.",4

its all about the experience - always the best in service and quality. that's why i go to lawry's. i'm from chicago and 1st time around lawry's in vegas. our waiter lou williams was patient and informative and made our night very special! i think brooke was helping him and she was bubbly and upbeat too. will visit lawry's always in every city in visit.,5

"there's something about that big bright green sign on the sombre, dignifed grey stone of the georgian buildings that just draws me in like a siren. a sucker for simple advertising (green = health)? moi?

i'm a bit of a foodie, a dabbler in cooking, and am becoming increasingly health-conscious in my old (ahem) age. gotta look after the motor. real foods is a slightly more up-market, with slightly more up-market price tags, purveyor of every health, organic food products, as well as beauty and household items, you can think of. add in all the spices and raw ingredients you'd need for cooking up the most amazing spiced lentil and bean stew with quinoa tabboleh and a side of baba ganoush...yep, real foods makes my brain think like that.

in fact you practically feel healthier just walking into the store and breathing in the smells of mingling spices.

i have to say i prefer the other branch, just off the meadows near tollcross, for some reason. that branch is a wee bit smaller, but it just feels a bit brighter. the layout of this store is a little weird. and whilst i'd buy all my dry ingredients here, i often find their fruit and veg to always look a little old and bruised. great for when you need black bananas for banana bread though!

overall, though, it's a nice store with a great range of produce. could just do with having a bit more browsing space, a less crushed register area, and fresher fruit and veg.",3
"i really love this gym.  it is large, clean and open long hours.  additionally, each machine has an individual tv so you can either watch or plug your ipod\/iphone in and listen to music.  the machines are also all set up to download your workout information into your device.

"ugh. they call themselves tailors,but they only do simple tailor work apparently. i have a jacket i got in england and wanted the cuffs hemmed. they do have two buttons with actual button holes, but not the most complex thing to do. i get the impression.that they are rather lazy and want to only basic stuff.

not only did they lose this job, but future business from me. too bad.",1

i did also take the occasional yoga class as well - totally worth it. actually, i never had a bad class here at all.

"i had some hope for this place. their menu online looked decent, and there have been some decent reviews.

my friends and i scoured the menu before coming, since people have mentioned it takes up to 30 minutes to cook the darned things. upon arriving, we learned that they had changed their menu, and jacked the prices up by $1-2 per burger. we had to spend more time looking at the menu since they removed 12 burgers from the menu they have on their website, and added 12 new ones. ugh..

i also read they had a lot of beers on tap. when we got there, i found they only had 6. a lot of their other taps were emptied. 

menu changes, reduced beers on tap, jacked up prices.. are all signs that point to a struggling restaurant to me. and i can see why..

i tried the gringo burger, and it was nothing fancy at all. a regular patty with a dollop of sour cream and store bought guac on it... the patty was a bit dry. 

they had a coin operated pool table and dart board upstairs. great right? well, it would be if the pool table wasn't missing a ball (which we found out after we paid $1.50 for it) and if the cues actually had tips on them. and if the place actually owned some darts!!! we asked the bartender for darts and he told us they didn't have any. what, did you have to hock off the darts to keep this place afloat?

save your time and money.",1

service is excellent, happy hour menu is wonderful, food is delicious and ambiance is great!

i won't label kultura as asian fusion or anything like that because their food is basically influenced by every continent in the world. i can see how less adventurous eaters wouldn't like this place because the flavour profile changes so dramatically between dishes. if experimenting with your palate isn't your game, then stick with the meat and potatoes because kultura ain't for you.

if you're still reading this review, then you're going to like kultura. there are caribbean, indian, japanese, thai, chinese, italian, and even french influences visible throughout all the dishes. park your traditional expectations of what these food styles should taste like at the door and you won't be disappointed...",4
this is a great place to buy a bed!! we walked in & joe gave us fantastic service! within 10 minutes found a great bed for an amazing deal! the beds were super comfortable and in various price ranges. easiest bed i've ever bought! i'd definitely recommend buying a bed here from joe!!,5

"one of my fav's.  stayed here 3 times and got upgraded each time for free.

pro's-hotel is amazingly huge, lobby is nice, checkin fast, staff is super attentive, casino is huge, almost maze like =) very nice decorative hallways and elevators, lots of shops and resturants for all price ranges which was a plus for me.  rooms were by far the biggest for vegas standards. central air, adjustable beds, comfy pillows, robes, free wifi, awesome strip views, marble bathroom, double sinks, tub, and seperate shower, spa toiletries. overall an amazing hotel for a standard price. they can actually charge more for the size of the rooms. free addmission to pool sundays for wet-republic.

con's- at night the hotel is popping in the casinos and bars so it can take a while to get through to the elevators to get to the rooms, and to get seated at a restaurant.  valet was terrible. do not do valet.  their ticket times are average 10 mins, its faster to just go to the parking garage.",5
"this place is ok, they don't try to up sell you on things you don't need and the prices are reasonable. i would have given a higher rating if i didn't have to bring  my car back to have them fix things they should have caught initially. their hours are business hours so getting off work multiple times to bring my car back is inconvenient. also, the last time i called them and left a message they didn't return my call. i would go back but i will also be looking for a place that pays a little more attention to detail and has better customer service.",3

"my sister is here for her yearly visit from nyc.  we always go to dinner with a few of my friends. last year we had a sub-par experience at wonder bar. i had to up my game.

we planned to go to tornado room but they were closed for their super bowl employee dinner.  i decided to give 1847 at the stamm a try. the reviews were mixed but the building looked beautiful. so 6 of us bundled up and headed out.

we arrived at 6 pm and there were a few people at the bar and just a handful of folks at a table. it was the evening of the super bowl and we cherished the fact that the restaurant was quiet. the building is just beautiful, a wonderful restoration indeed. we were seated upstairs and were very comfortable at the  roomy rectangular table. a couple of folks had a glass of wine and i had a sazerac, straight up. it was delicious, cold and packed a punch.

we all were more than satisfied with our meals. the roasted half chicken was very moist and flavorful. it was served with spaetzle and a red eye gravy. i got to eat my sisters' leftovers and i certainly would consider ordering this the next time i go. the serving was quite generous. two people had the lake trout which was served with wild rice, cauliflower, mustard greens and squash. they both found the fish and accompaniments to be perfectly prepared and seasoned. 

i ordered the mussels and frites. i am really picky about my mussels. although the mussels were somewhat small, they were prepared with love. the mussels were cooked in a luscious broth of absinthe, charred leeks, chilies, garlic and sherry butter. nestled in the good sized bucket of mussels was a lovely piece of toasted baguette which i used for dipping. the frites were ""to die for"". i salivate thinking about them.

the group split some yummy profiteroles and the rest of us shared a little apple flan that didn't seem like a flan at all. whatever is was, it was tasty, light and lovely.

i know that there have been quite a few damning reviews of 1847 at the stamm house. i was hesitant to give it a try. i think we were lucky to be there on super bowl evening. we had excellent service and the food pleased all 6 of us, no small feat. we were given a little tour and got to see the ""cave"" which a windowless stone room. i thought it was charming and might increase the chances of a big group (up to 10) being able to hear each other on a busy night.

i hope the restaurant will find a way to control the din when they are full. they need to provide the excellent food and service we received, each and every night. they could be one of the standout restaurants in a very crowded madison field. i look forward to my next visit.",5
"after reading all the yelp reviews, i was dying to try this place out and see what all the hype was about.  my friend took me here for my birthday and i was not disappointed.  it was a thursday night at 8pm and it was packed!  the hostess told us 25 minutes, and not more than 20 minutes later, we were seated and ready to order.  

unlike many other ayce, you are not constantly hounded by the waitress to place an order.  in fact, they are very courteous and check on you just enough so that you are always able to order but not rushed in any way.  

i can't remember specifically what we ordered, but it was a lot of nigiri and rolls and everything was simply amazing.  the pork belly appetizer was also very very good.  my only complaint is that it was a tiny serving so we had to keep ordering more.  you can order the rolls in half orders so that you can try more stuff off the menu.  the only thing i did not particularly like was the calamari tempura.  it was like rubbery fish sticks in tempura batter. yuck.

everyone is right that the nigiri rice portions are very reasonably small, unlike a lot of other ayce places.  this has become one of my favorite sushi places and i can't wait to go back!!",5

"joel and his staff has always delivered what was expected. if for some reason they were unable to have the exact flower for and arrangement saw on the website, they called to let me know what would be the replacement that was very similar to picture. i have ordered many times from them and always please with the final product.",5
"i found i clean carpets on yelp and decided to try it based on all of the great reviews and it was a great choice. when i initially called i had to leave a voicemail and he got right back to me to schedule an appointment. he went out of his way to be accommodating. i didn't think to tell him that my apartment is on the third floor which was my fault so when he came he didn't have a hose long enough to reach. this was totally my fault but he made sure to fit me into the schedule he very next day when he could get the longer hose. lastly, he didn't give one quote and then show up and try to add on a bunch of additional costs like other companies do. he was very thorough and i will definitely use him again.",5
"hello, k a b o b!

so, this place is in a food court at the venetian grand canal shoppes. 

ian wanted a pizza so, the mrs. and ian placed an order from social life pizza. after looking at all the available options, i felt like a kabob. so, i decided to dine from here. i placed my order, and a buzzer was handed to me. the very strong buzzer went off within 10 minutes. *laughs* i picked up the piping hot food, tapatio sauce, plastic cutlery, paper towels and proceeded to have a wonderful meal.

i had the following:
original gyro plate with rice and white pita ($9.99)
half order hummus with pita ($2.99)
1 pepsi 32 oz (3.50)

total with tax came to $17.83

pros:
very friendly employee and a knowledgeable owner at the counter?
food is being prepared fresh. the skewers of kabob's over the fire is an appetizing view behind the counter.
gyro was delicious. 

cons:
holding the gyro wrapped in the pita was a tad bit difficult. should ask the stuffing separate if you do not want to leave a mess around your mouth. trust me :)",4
"i came here to see john legend and the concert was amazing.  john legend can definitely sing and is a real musician!  it was my first time here and i can tell you that this place is wonderful in the summertime.  the sound is great and there are two large screens.  i had great seats sitting dead center in the vip section where we had in seat service.

drinks are expensive as you would expect at any special concert venue.  i paid $15 for a tallboy beer and $3 for a 350ml bottle of dasani water.  popcorn is $7.50 and you can order other items for a pretty penny.  pizza pizza slice is $5.50.  make sure you eat a hefty meal if you feel like saving money.

the concerts here are great and i suggest you stat away from the lawn seats if you plan on being comfortable.",4

"generally when i go somewhere new,  especially for sushi, i leave with at least some type of memorable moment of the meal that allows me to write a review. this is not one of those times.

my only memories of sushi loca are the fact that it doesn't have an identity. it has the design and decor of a trendy upscale restaurant, with a menu that looks like it was written by a horny 15 year old boy. some of the rolls have ridiculously perverted names for no reason. oh, and they were playing 90's rock which just confused the shit out of me.

the food? as i mentioned before, it was less than memorable. my favorite part of the meal happened to be the free pre-meal sample of a cucmber salad that was really enjoyable. the sushi itself was fresh but the flavor combinations just seemed a bit confusing and overly ambitious. i'll stick to naked fish and sen of japan for my daring sushi choices.",3
went in there's for a late lunch at 2:30. there were 3 tables on the patio including us. we sat there 15 mins and got up and left with no sign of a server or anyone to greet us. too bad. was our first time and the menu looked delicious.,1
i absolutely love them! their pizza sauce has this amazing spice to it that definitely makes the pizza special! from their lunch specials to their full size pizzas you can't go wrong! i love stopping in for lunch the service is always timely and amazing! they're one of the two only places that serves egees in this area i use to drive to tucson for.,5
"i've got to update and upgrade my review here. not only has it been almost three years since i've reviewed it, but the clp has done some serious renovations over the past few years. how could i, a bibliophile (thanks to my librarian mother) who uses the library regularly, have been so remiss? 

so my sister-in-law called me up and asked me if i'd like to take my niece allison to the library today to help with a project on mark twain. would i?! are the beach boys over the hill?  does ticketmaster still rip people off?  did steinbeck and dickens write good books?  asking me to help someone find a book is like asking an etymologist to find words.  allison's at the age now where she's using the adult section.

we also saw a fine program today, ""hurricanes, lightning and tornadoes, oh my!"" featuring dennis bowman from kdka-tv.  he gave several weather related demonstrations including how tornadoes are formed and how weather balloons work.

"honestly, i was expecting a lot more considering the high prices and the things that people say about it. i had the raspberry cheesecake and honestly it didn't taste like cheesecake at all. at most it was like a bland vanilla. the waffle cone was pretty soggy and just didn't have that crunch to it. overall, i was pretty disappointed but was craving ice cream and it was the only place that was open past 11 nearby yonge and dundas. i really would've much rather had baskin robins.",2
"[review is of urgent care clinic, not dr. gerace]

i swear i'm not a hypochondriac, but in the past 3 months, i've fully taken advantage of having medical insurance.  and the lucky recipient of my unitedhealth plan--allcare.  

i found out about allcare after a curtailed search on yelp (www.yelp.com :) ), and have not regretted a moment since.  walking into the smallish but professional waiting area in allcare, i was given forms to fill out and sign by people who *actually seemed to like where they worked.*  that's important.  the wait has never been more than 5 minutes, not even enough to finish the chapter of whatever book i was currently reading.  the rooms are small, but efficient, with the normal pictures of digestive tracts, people who seem happy to be prodded and poked at.  

[i'm not a fan of going to see doctors and hospitals.  in fact, they creep me out, terrify me, and makes me want to cry, sometimes all at the same time.]

i've only really spoken with pts, but on the whole, they were informed, able to answer my avalanche of questions, and politely refrained from telling me that i'm a hypochondriac to my face.  i've also had numerous points of contact with the blood-tech... tony....  i can't imagine drawing blood for a living, for one, i don't think i have the right shade of red.  and i learned another reason--i am completely freaked out by blood, especially the idea and action of someone taking blood from me.  if you go, and see tony, shake his hand, because he had to put up with a lot from me.  (i quickly learned that i need to be lying down, and that i will hyperventilate and collapse into hysteria... for about 10 minutes).

so yeah, if you want somewhere clean, professional, not pretentious and yet still pretty cool... allcare is highly recommended (at least by me).

on a side note, i plan on transferring my primary care to dr. gerace as soon as i get un-lazy enough.",5

lahaina used to have an ""all you can eat"" deal (which is tragic but delicious after a long night out) ... i was informed by our server that this was discontinued because they wanted to ""emphasize their hot dishes"" and not just ""cater to the people who want all you can eat sushi""

ok... so you alienate you base clientele by getting rid of what was, no doubt, your best selling option in order to push food that i don't want? interesting business model... let me know how that goes for ya. 

the food is very average. fresh enough, but nothing special. drinks are cheap so thats good... i guess.",3
"i hardly go out to hot pot so this is only my 2-3 time but i was impressed with rolling pot as everyone got their individual pot and you could choose your own personal soap base.  the quality of food was fine, the beef was a little too thin but it was good.  there is a sauce station for you to play around in, some are weird that i wouldn't think of putting in.  service was quick as well but like most ayce places they keep forgetting some of our orders and i had to order 3-4 times before a some portion came.  pricing was decent for what you got but not much seafood in the price except for like shrimps.",4
"there are plenty of reviews for this restaurant already.  i really just want to upload a picture of my favorite drink there.  bottomline is if you are looking for a cantonese-style cafe, then wendy's is for you.  this is as good as it gets in vegas.  ho sick!  (that's ""good eats"" in cantonese.)",4
"solid, solid, solid.  at our table, and all around us, people were enjoying ( and finishing) all of their dishes.  the soup and various salads were great starters.  we ran the gamut on entrees (risotto, steak, pork chop, scallops) and each diner thought they made the best choice from the menu.  this was the second time we had the brookie for dessert and will likely have it the next time we are there ( the apple pie in a bag was also good).

the restaurant is open and airy, and it is fun to watch the kitchen and plate finishing table in action.  the (identical looking) wait staff was attentive and helpful (suggesting the $27 pork chop vs. $37 filet was refreshing to see) and the drink list was creative.  take a wander into the restrooms just to see the ""wallpaper"" and to use the soap salt.

honey salt offers a very good meal in a nice setting.  we'll be back.",4
"i had a good time with a group of coworkers. the weather was very pleasant and we sat near enough to the street to enjoy the weather but not be impacted by the traffic sounds.  everyone but me was from out of town. one of them is also a yelper and was excited to try the meatballs. i was pleasantly surprised that i could just order one meatball for 3.50.  awesome, so i ordered two and split an order of brussel sprouts with a coworker.  i tried the vegetarian and the beef, both in marinara sauce.  the beef was great, the vegetarian not so much.  maybe a different sauce would have helped, there are many to choose from.  as other reviewers have stated, the meatballs could be warmer.  the brussel spouts were good also. splitting an order is a good idea because the portion is huge!  what i liked the best were the fried pickles.  i think these were the best fried pickles i've ever had.  each of us enjoyed the pickles!!  you can imagine parking would be difficult downtown. but i have found parking right at a corner lot at penn & 10th to be convenient. it was $12 the night i was there. as a comparison, a lot in the strip near the heinz history center was 5$.  (the prices can fluctuate widely day by day depending the events going on, etc.) so great time especially with a group.",4
"this club has a lot to offer on one campus!  it's much more than just a golf course.

the golf course is a true walking course.  the carefully designed layout makes it easier for tournament golfers or anyone that wants to walk the holes.  the greens and fairways are well maintained. the groundskeeper has chosen flowers and natural landscaping that brings out the natural beauty of this mature course.  you will find a few challenging water hazards.  hole 11(par 5) is challenging.  hole ten is my favorite hole(par 4) it is straight on but you must avoid several bunkers.

the dining at cabarrus is a pleasant experience as well.  from hot dogs to prime rib the menu is diverse.  they have special occasion buffets that are really good.  the chef works hard to keep the menu exciting.  sunday brunch is always a hit.  my personal favorite menu item is the reuben sandwich.

the club also offers tennis and swimming.  all of the sports at cabarrus have organized competitions.  the club sends out a newsletter and special emails to alert everyone of club sponsored events.  they really put the fun in swimming, tennis, and golf!  they also offer lessons and private instruction from experts in the sport.

they have an amazing reception hall for weddings, wedding receptions, class reunions, or any event that needs a large opulent area.  the on-site catering of food simplifies the planning of events.  the spacious well-lit parking lot provides plenty of close parking for any event.   everything done here is first class!",5
"i've been curious about this place for a while now, but never checked it out because honestly, it didn't have a yelp review. but, after going to multiple eyebrow-shaping places that were...meh, i decided to give this place a try.

i went in for a highbrow appointment.  i was able to book same-day and had the option of getting it waxed or threaded.  i opted for threaded.

here are some notes on my actual brow experience:
- the lady had really nice eyebrows, and she was really cool.  she asked me what i was looking for and advised that my arch was too centered, and she's going to work on moving it to flatter my face shape better, but said that it would take a few appointments, which made sense.
- she spent a lot of time plucking, trimming etc...before the actual threading. i felt like she was really taking her time and working to shape my brows.
-after threading, she put some aloe on my skin to sooth it, and coloured in my brows. she then took me through how she coloured them in, and told me to come back in a month.

the end result was amazing. i have very faint, sparse eyebrows and it actually looked like i had them now, and it didn't look fake. i'm a repeat customer for sure.",5
"steve really has an eye for detail. great service, beautiful room, and great price.",5
"i'd heard nothing but good things about nando's in the past but never actually visited one. i have to admit it was a pretty enjoyable experience.


 the fountain park branch is only a few minutes walk from my flat so made it an easy choice for sunday dinner when feeling too lazy to cook. the place was big enough that we didn't have to queue to get a table but not so cavernous that it ruins any atmosphere.


 being a bit of a chicken wing fan i went straight for the portion of 10 with a side of chips. i am scottish after all. my partner has a quarter chicken with sides of rice and coleslaw. the staff member at the counter asked if we'd visited nando's before and told us we were very brave opting for the hot sauce as first time visitors. we're fans of spicy food though and would probably have rated this more medium than hot. just a pleasant amount of heat with plenty of flavour.


 if there's not enough heat in the marinade for you they prvide bottles of sauce of each heat level to take to your table so you can spice it up 'til your hearts content.


 the wings were perfectly cooked with the meat just falling off the bone. chips are chips and i can't think of anything exciting to say about them.


 with top-ups of your soft drink also included and a takeaway service available i'll be more than happy to become a regular at nando's",4
i walk by this place all the time and decided to try it. i was disappointed with both the portion size and the food. i originally only wanted to try their cold noodles but when the noodles came i knew it wasn't enough food so i also ordered the takoyaki. the noodles though were presented well were undercooked in a mediocre soup with half an egg and 2 pieces of crabmeat. the takoyaki didn't really have octopus. the food is was definitely not worth what i paid. the only good part was the service.,2
"get ready to spend some money here :d just kidding. 

don't let the stars scare you away. this is a good sushi joint. they have a lot of space but not that many servers. service was slow but things happen when they're short staff. 

the food is really food. check out the uni custard, their oysters and sashimi\/sushi platters. please don't go in here and order rolls, especially california rolls.... this is not the place for it and you'd be wasting your money. don't expect big portions. if you love sushi, meaning raw fish and is looking for something adventurous, i'd tell you to give this a try and just let good food do the work. sometimes good food makes up for it all :)",4
i can't speak too much to the food all i can say is the staff is so amazing here and they are always friendly and warm .. they make some authentic stuff from what i can see and it is always delicious but i have to be honest that i've not had lots of thai places so i can't throw down culinary expertise but i do love this place,5
"so i have been trying to try all the cool new food joints in downtown gilbert. today it was joyride taco house. it was a weekday, so less of a crowd, always a good thing. our server ""floyd"" seated us quickly. we told her this was our first time here and she told us about how everything is fresh,  home made . to start they bring out this crazy great salsa, i was blown away by its unique flavor. it was with a hint of sweet, citrus, spice, chunky, which equalled a explosion of awesome flavors!!! we had the lunch special. we each picked three tacos with a free side. the crispy fish taco is insane! the grilled fish taco a close second. the braised beef is good, but the fish is my favorite. my wife too loved the crispy fish and really loved ""the standard"" chicken taco.the tacos are not big, but three of them was enough. me and my wife shared a bowl of tortilla soup, fresh, and soooo good. we will be back for sure, got to try other things, but it will be hard not to order the fish tacos again. thanks to our very nice and helpful server, she made our visit even nicer!!",4
"since my beloved cigar-home cubanos mysteriously and suddenly went out of business i have been casting about for a new place to sit every so often and try a new stogie. this will, alas, not be it. 

nothing wrong with the place really. they have a nice, large humidor with all of the things you would expect. the service was okay. the guy seemed a little suspicious of me. maybe because i told him that i was a former cubanos customer and he thought i had bad-luck cooties. or maybe because he caught me talking to one of his customers in the humidor (not my fault, the guys asked me for my opinion on some cigars and i have him an honest answer). in any case, he was not too talkative to me. 

this is also another one of those places with a membership cigar lounge for the beautiful people. i hate that, so i subtract a star. the conversation, from what i could overhear (no one was talking to me, the new guy), centered around sports, which is typical. the thing i loved about cubanos was that the owner was always an interesting conversationalist. very hard to find. 

in all, probably a better store for you than me. check it out if you are in the area. it is too far of a drive for me based on my experience today.",2
"we heard there's a 15 minute wait for counter service. yes, it's rush time. it's 6:30pm. the woman in front of us ordered only an iced tea and waited over 11 minutes. the table we selected had a fully empty napkin dispenser, all the tables were dirty. but! from order to when the manager brought the food to our table was only 6 minutes. i call that a win. as always quality food, great atmosphere, and good service. we will be back.",4
i just had the worst experience going to palm beach tan the girl that work there katlyn would not tell me about the specials and coupons they had going on she was very rude when i asked her questions and did not want to be bothered. never coming back. my cousin (who has a membership) told me to go because they had a special for 1 free spray tan for first time users. the girl that told her about it said to just come in and ask for it. headed to body heat tanning.,1
"service was not very good. they seemed short handed. the food was just okay. too many other good places, don't think i would go back. one suggestion for them, lose the paper napkins wrapped around the silver ware. that's okay for breakfast or lunch, not dinner",2
"we've eaten here about 3 times the food is good i'm able to eat gluten free this is what has brought us back . today was a different visit the waitress made it a point to know she was just about to get off early but then we sat down. the restaurant was still supposed to be open for another 2 hours. she messed up my husband drink  order 3 times and when she would walk away she was rolling her eyes. she made us so uncomfortable for us. the bus staff was great the buser was the person  who actually helped us more then the waitress.  because of them i'll give them another shot, but i'd definitely not go with the same server.",3
"there are a lot of things that i like about this restaurant. the first thing that i like the most is the ambiance and accommodations. we sat on a booth in their outdoor patio and enjoyed the nice weather. the service was great and the food came promptly. 

another thing that i like about this restaurant is the variety of food. i like that it offers a variety of seafood including sushi. i ordered their sushi platter and it had 1 roll (8 pieces) and 6 pieces of nigiri. i also ordered their fish tacos and these were super good. their portion of fish was really hearty!

as an appetizer i had their artichoke and calamari. both these dishes were good. next time i visit though, i don't think i will be repeating the calamari. even though it was tasty, it really didn't have anything special. 

i think it is important to note that the place does get busy. i would suggest doing a reservation which can be done online. when i was there there was a party of at least 15 and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves. point is, that it looks like a great spot for big parties.",4
"vida is absolutely amazing! she got everything i wanted exactly right! cut, color and keratin treatment came out perfect! if you have curly hair go see vida you won't be disappointed!",5
"the food was good, but like another reviewer said, ""what happened to my amuse buche?"". at these prices, i want my amuse buche! the food was good, the view of the lake and the fountain was great and dessert was fabulous. but the prices...at these prices, it could have been better.",3
