As the input to the overall network is a square image, each image here will also be square. Thus, each channel of the second max-pooling layer will also store a square image; if we call the height and width of this square image $x$, then $2048 = 128 \\cdot x \\cdot x$. Solving for $x$, we get that $x = 4$. Thus, the 4-by-4 max pooling layer's output shape per input data point is (128, 4, 4)."

Of course, the image could be slightly larger, and the 4-by-4 max-pooling layer will ignore the additional rows and columns.

Then the input to the second Conv2D layer is (64, 19, 19) --- the 4-by-4 filters used shrink each image to be 16-by-16. Then the input to the first max-pooling layer has minimum size (64, 38, 38).

      "the honda crv ex-l 2015 idles rough/vibrates profusely when in drive/foot on brake. the steering wheel, headrests, items in the cup holder all rattle/vibrate vigorously when the vehicle is idling at approx. 550-600 rpm. even the back seats carry the vibration of the vehicle. my children (back seat passengers) now complain of nausea/headaches when in the vehicle for prolonged periods of time. this is much more than an 'annoyance'. this is extremely distracting to the driver, causing the driver to potentially loose focus on what is important, which is safe driving. i've had passengers comment on the vigorous vibration as well. we have brought the vehicle in for service numerous times. the vibration/rough idle was indeed confirmed; however, there is no way for the service dept to fix. a service request has been sent to honda as there is no 'fix' at this time. completely unacceptable for a new vehicle. there are many consistent complaints of this exact problem on reputable websites all stating that honda is not fixing the problem. *tr\n"
